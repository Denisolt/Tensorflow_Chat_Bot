Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Why?
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
But
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Wear the belly before you go.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Get out!
That girl -- I --
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What've you got for me?
What 're you talking about?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
What'd he say?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
You hate me don't you?
Are you following me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I thought you were above all that
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
The Partridge Family?
You up for it?
The duck?
No, I won't go with you
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
My grandmother's .
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
Why can't we agree on this?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Which parts?
Kat a fan, too?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
You were right. She's still pissed.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
You can see for yourself.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
May I ask by whom?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
What does he say?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Say not here!  Cuba!
Chief knows.
To bring the word of God.
How can you be so certain?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
New worlds create new people.
Do they have such thoughts?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Now I become custody of police department?
Are you married?
I can't take you to my place.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Are you alright?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
A cop?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Hmmmm.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You thirsty?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I kill someone famous.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
How many victims are up there?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Stop it.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Okay.  You ready?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that fucking thing off!
Get in the bathroom!
Let me get a shot of it.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Traitor!!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
Viewer discretion advised!
Well, he...
I'm trying to tell you.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
New York.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
What??
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Okay. 
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
You're kidding.
Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Well, don't worry about it.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Fortunately, they did.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
I see.
That's true.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Yeah?
Name?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here you go, baby.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Where's ganz?
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Let's go.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
Where's the money?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Where's luther?
That was quick.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
You look awful.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I'm all wet.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Call me later.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Stall.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
Five.  On credit.
What're you laughing about?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Why?  What's wrong with me?
He's a she!
We have to save the world.
What are you doing?
Leeloo's in trouble?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
What are we going to do?
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
They really made her...
Where's Leeloo?
At least, the cat comes back.
...Priest...
...What's your name?
The Fifth Element...
...Hello?
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Six to the left. One to the right.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
You hear that?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The cash man!
It's not?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
They just landed in the desert.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Am I disturbing you?
I love you.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Anything harder?
What are you talking about?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
I want to watch you work.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
What's the problem?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Is that him?
What's he talking about?
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Keep moving.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Remember me?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
How much do you make now?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
He succeeded.
You... you need to go to the police.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
Why do you think he did it?
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
Her belongings?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Rick...I can't.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I'm sure they're around.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
What the hell was that?
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Been up with Alice.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
What?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Hi, beautiful.
About him?
How was the meeting?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
You, too?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I think you're right.
Yeah?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Who?
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
If you get it?
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Double A. New Britain.
Safety on?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Saw him do it?
What then?
It's fun.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Are we going in this?
Pop?
What do you want, then?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
That's illegal, you know.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
It's just...
No problem. Look, I...
I still don't understand --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
You don't mean that.
Money.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
You've been married twice --
I know your parents.
Strange.
This is nuts.
What happened?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
You're not using it today?
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
Marg!
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Yeah.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
What about Margie?
Which is?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I don't drink coffee.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Daddy...
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Put your pilot on.
Uh, we got a problem here.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
And all these rooms here?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Leave my daughter alone.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Stop.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
You know what?
How did your speech go?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
What?
Did you feel that?
Dunn.
It's got to be stopped!
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Elaine.
You mean...
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, what's happening?!
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That's not possible.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Can I hold him?
No.  Poached.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You've been hurt.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
What did he have?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Ted...
We'd better get back now.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's right on the heading.
How ya doing, honey?
Hi!
Oh, I'd love to.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
What is this?
Why did you do it?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
I'm going home.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!

With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
What?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
This floor's freezing.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's right.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
So.
I told them to fall back...
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Let's go!  Let's go!
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
What's this?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
No, it's different, honey.
Don't go!  Please.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
The marriage!
What?
Hardly.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Why what, sir?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Wolfi!
Yes, my love?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
You're not going to do this?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Give me one reason I can understand.
Really?
Alone.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
What are you doing here?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Upstairs.
Just one year.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Sire.
Why not?
Your Majesty!
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, what about him?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
What medicine?
Is he working?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
What did he say? What did he say?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Yes.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
How could I not?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Herr Sommer.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
Ah. Italian?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
How fortunate.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
With all my heart, Mozart.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Did my work please you?
You flatter me.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
What happened? Is it over?
Where is your wife?
Where did I stop?
Strange!
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
It couldn't be simpler.
With the tenors.
That's wonderful!
And that's it. Do you have it?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly. A dance.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
So?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
He's setting that play to music?
What anger?
Ballet? What ballet?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
But he's all right?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Go about your duties.
He's not?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Dr. Hirsch?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
I was. What are you reading?
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
I'm twenty-seven.
Yes, go on.
What?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
I think he's a Jew.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Some, everyone does.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Two weeks?
There were witnesses?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Yes.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Jack.
Well, I like it here.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Nice looking group.
Right.
What the hell was that all about?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Heathcliffe.
It's in front of us.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
I'm not listening!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Jack, are you really dead?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Because this must be stopped.
Dr. Hirsch?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Sorry, love.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where's Matt?
Charlie!
I remember once when your account checked.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
And tell him not to delay.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
What do you mean?
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
Why, Matt!
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Yes, of course.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Yes?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Well, I—
No. I won't.
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
I'm afraid so.
No.
Yes.
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He was in the bank yesterday.
What did you find out, Mike?
Dude Finlay?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Then who changed it?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
You have no shame.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
Ride with me, cousin?
Jesse, we got to have a word.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
A bad idea.
Still smells fishy.
We'll make them pay for this.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Well?
Then why can't I go in there?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Boys...
Daddy, don't start with this again.
That would have made an impression.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
That just might work.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
You've killed your fair share of men.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Really?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Really!
Your men knew the risks.
That.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
On a lot of lithium?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
I know. Stop it.
You like it there, don't you?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Why?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
He's rich.
He's good-looking.
I want a firm commitment.
Why? What's wrong?
You're really serious, aren't you?
Where are you going?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Are you my two o'clock?
I think you should go now.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
What's that, a gram?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Don't, I'll drink it.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Dorsia, yes?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
What is it?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
...to the office this afternoon.
Just...say...no!
So, what do you do?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Don't tell him you're here.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Oh no, I'm okay.
How well did you know him?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Have you consulted a psychic?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Nothing.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
What?
He does? You're sure?
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Hey, Halberstam?
Is it over?
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
...But?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
That was -- different.
Great!
You look beautiful.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
...When did you know?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Who's that?
...Hello?
Cool!
You know a lot about art, I guess.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
How's it going?
You did this -- overnight?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
I think you should go.
Just thought his work should go on.
What're we looking for?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
You know mine.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
He's out of prison?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Time?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
I told Teddy about you.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Please don't go.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
...He knows.
...You got my E-mail?
Is that how Larry feels?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
You seem surprised to see me.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
May I wash you?
Care for some saki?
Thank you.
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
When do I begin?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Hello, Exposition.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Be careful.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Why did you leave so soon?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Fancy a nibble?
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Really, Austin!
No, did you use a condom?
Hello, luv.
Does that make you horny?
Austin, what's your point?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
What is it now?
Hi.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
You didn't...
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
What about his teeth?
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
What do you want to do, Scott?
Really?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Red ...
Quite a collection.
People, too.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
An unholy trinity ...
Such as?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I was about to throw in the towel.
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
But why? What's the point?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
No thanks.
Strange.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Is that what you think?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
Steed ... !
You followed me.
What is it?
I'll be back ...
Mrs. Peel?
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Oh, hello ...
Steed
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You're kidding.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
And...
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, we've got to talk.
God, you're a slob.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Huh? Wha...
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
I hope Ilene's all right.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where'd she go?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Reach out and snort someone.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
You gotta let me finish --
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
I like what you've done with the place.
In the Field Museum once.
Ya love it, probie?
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
You okay?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
...Not now, Brian.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
I'll handle it.
Thanks for calling.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hey.
Hi.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Thanks for the invite.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Brian. What's wrong?
I was doing my job.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
I don't know anything about it.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
What is --
What'll you do?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
-- Shhh.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
So what do you want me to do?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Completely out of control.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Fireman shit?
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
He just wants to --
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Look, I'm sorry I --
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Shadow.
Who's this?
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I'm a little busy right now --
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
You took the chalice.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
He gots to be did.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
So that's what you been doing?
You can walk away.  We both can.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
That ain't funny.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
Word!!!
I'm feelin' dis'!
That's a great handle.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Yep, you guessed it.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
I'm in till the end.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Your life will never be the same.
What is this?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
How so?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
So they can be on TV.
No joke.  Serious.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
Mommy, please don't call me that.
No.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Let Myrna finish.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Not her, the one with the little...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I heard ya lady is wild.
...not that time...
...perfect...
I fell out of my bed last night.
I don't know who I am.
I feel a song a comin' on.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Maybe you need to start.
And?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Aw, c'mon.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Where are you bound for?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I don't know.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Never.
Not one.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Does this assignment interest you?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Papa?
Yes, he's fine.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Bill Styles...
You framed-him...
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I don't know... I like the Army.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
That'd be my reaction too --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
So you killed him?
What do you mean, West's?
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
His chest was hamburger --
I... I don't know...
What happened to "degrees"?
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
That bad?
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Ah, Christ
Is Dunbar cute?
Baseball?
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're kidding.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
What?
I pushed him too hard.
So what now?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
No.
Hardy, what are you doing --
This isn't the time --
That's not true.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Do I have a choice in this?
He was your friend.
How?
I don't think I want to hear this --
We should tell him we're not going.
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
What happened with Nunez?
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
This is totally unnecessary --
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Didn't kill anything, did I?
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
How long have you known my father?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Well, she... uh...
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
So I've heard.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Karl.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Jesus Christ.
The one about the witch.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Son?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Oh.
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
This is it? The whole vault.
How did you know my father?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
I'm going to check on him.
You need to go.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
How much time does he have left?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Mom?
You know what for.
Yeah it was okay.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hold on.
Right.
So?
You must have a visa or something...
Put the fucking kettle down.
Is that everything?
So what are you going to do?
I do. I want to very badly.
Where's the restroom?
What?
Fine.
Oh Jesus.
Excuse me?
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
How do you want to pay?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I bet you have loyal customers.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
What happened?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Better than what you give.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Where's Ronnie?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Let me say somethin' first...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Want another?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Where you gonna be?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
He tapped that.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Then what?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Thank you.
You a preacher?
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
I just wanted some make-up.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
What are they doing now?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Nick... You up?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Getting very weird.
Are you expecting anyone?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
I'm sorry.
What's that for?
Don't give him any more.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Where's the wife?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Can't make you change your mind?
She's such a long way home for you.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I've done some questionable things.
What generation are you?
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He could?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
You're our best and only friend.
I think, therefore I am.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
You start.
Not if it works.
You want to see my friends?
Prosit.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Money?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
You're going to be over the limit.
What if you change your mind?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Jeezus!
Me.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
I told you I'd come back.
Where is he?
How come you're not on the job?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
You're sick, Deckard.
Uh-huh.
Ten years.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
What?
Know what a turtle is?
What's your name?
Methuselah Syndrome.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Your mom was a dancer?
My office.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Please excuse this interruption.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Over this?
I can't, it's yours.
Why are you doing that?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
...Okay.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
I guess we'll need another locker.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Bites what?
It does?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
I was wrong!!
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
May I please be excused?
The guy with the underpants!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I thought I was here to meet women.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I'm leaving, too.
I'm really sorry!
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Uh-huh. Adam?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
A card?
How do I leave here?
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
What's baseball?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
...the pipe tobacco.
You have very nice ceilings.
Not particularly.
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
What's the capitol?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Yes. He likes windows.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
What?!
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
You bet!
And thanks for always being happy!
You don't look thirty-five.
I don't see anything!
Elbows, Son.
Dad!
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No.
Oh, my God!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
He drank it hot?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Well, put it down and come in!
No.  They all do.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
What's that noise?
The locks?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Watch this!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Calvin!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, what do you think?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
What's that mean?
What?
What do you want to do with it?
And if we can't find him?
I don't know. I like to think so.
To get some frozen poultry.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Adam!!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Jeffrey?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Okay?
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
Not yet.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
I made it go down the toilet.
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Who is Don?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me, don't you?
Do you love me?
Yes.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No, you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hi Dad.
Oh yeah?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Are you alright?
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey? Why?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Hey, I just...
Lord's name.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
What?
Anybody see ya?
Shit.
Mother, is that you?
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
We're alive.
Oh, Jesus.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Nervous?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
So what do you think?
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
So, what do we do now?
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Right now.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Fuck you!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
I guess not.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Have you no fear of God?
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's really kind of hot.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
But he didn't say anything.
There's another stocker, right?
Yeah.
See if mine are in there.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Inez, this is --
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
I think we better go home.
I had to give some to Inez.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
That's what she is!
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What time did he say to be here?
What do you think?
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
He was a nice guy.
Uh-huh?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Help me move him.
Who tripped the alarm?
Where's Kumar?
Come on.
What?
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
What'd he get?
Why?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
You mean like techniques?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Did Dignan take the test?
No, that door over there.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
We're renegades from despair.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Where you going?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Give him a second.
It's in the driveway.
How do you say nineteen?
What?  What?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Where'd she go?
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Bob, will you please listen?
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Dignan.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Come on!
Scarecrow?
What's wrong with Applejack?
The elevator broke.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Oh, yeah.
Where?
Is that your chiquita?
How's the weather down there?
Come on in!
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Excuse me.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Had to be done.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Show me again...
You know I'm not.
So why didn't you kill me then?
Pamela Landy?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- car keys?
-- it hasn't been two years --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
No... How?
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I wanted to kill him.
I know it's a dream.
You hear me? I believed you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Say it.
Why are you here, then?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
My first job.
It's me.
Who?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
You're sure?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
How long have you worked for the agency?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Believed what?
Some women like Dobermans --
Do we know what this says?
Anything?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
What are they doing?
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Does anyone know his politics?
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
The little cow is insane --
That's just a dream, William!
Keep these. We're going too.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We must run in different directions!
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
You've been here before?
I want... to marry you!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Then when?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Who would do such a thing?
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
You know the answer to that.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Are you hurting her?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Are you stupid or what?
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Are you okay?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
What's happened to you?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Oh? There's proof now?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Just get out, didja?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Lenny? Come on!
Here you go, buddy.
So you decided to go to America.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Er, goodbye, sir.
What do you want for Sam?
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
And Mademoiselle?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yes, of course, we --
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
And then?
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Did he give any reason?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Yes.
Well, this might come in handy.
No. It's all arranged.
I understand.
No, Captain, please.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
And that is?
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Victor Laszlo.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Uh huh.
Give me another.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Make it official, if you like.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Boss!
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
No. Not me, boss.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
It's bad.
No.
You're putting off the inevitable.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
No.  that was the last one.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Four four.  A record.
Hey, look at you.
I have to.
I would never --
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What was inside?
That about sums it up.
You okay?
I love you, Chuck.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
When's the next Jumbo?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
I am one lucky guy.
If you say you are.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Kamal is not here.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Hello.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
I mean your parents.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
So. Not bored yet?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
At least you were never lonely.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
I know, I'm sorry.
"...did." Well, okay.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
That's true.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Is *your* father dead?
Did you know your mother better?
What's a nanny do?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
What kind of plane are you flying?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
They're migrants.
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
What's that? What's it called?
I'm stayin', Homer.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
It looks like scurvy.
It's obviously an aborticide.
I don't think so.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
You okay, Rose?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Do you know him?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Nice.
We were back on.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
So we go to the bar.
Ten is standard, sir.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
Shit.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
When?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You can't cheat an honest man.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Come on. Harder.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What -- What do we do?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
That's not --
Says who?
You need to get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
It's more than that.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
He was looking out for you.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Jesus... Take it easy.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
You tell them the "Tale".
Meet me at my place later.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Why?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
We're getting a little old for running.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What'd he say?
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
You sell it.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I'll take you up on that.
I got scared.
The Indian rope-trick.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
How about fifteen hundred?
I don't gamble.
I couldn't resist them.
Where did you get it?
It came my way. 450 a week.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
How did it go?
I loved it blond.
Are you drunk?
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Really?
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
No.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
What happened?
Which side do you like?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I'm in trouble.
I know that. But you can now.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And your hand too.
Did you solve your problems?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
She's my baby.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
How many aces are left?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Yeah.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
What's he doin'?
The key!
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is the key?
What was that, I didn't hear...
Fuck that shit.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Armed.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
You are false data.
It is intuitively obvious.
This is fun.
Why don't you have more time?
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Oh, yeah?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
How're ya doin', Max.
What is it?
Lemme put some clothes on.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
You're a thief?
Thank God.
Who is...
Lemme get my coat.
Girlfriend?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
The other one like you...
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
Well, not me personally.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
None.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Morning, Sunshine...
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Yeah.
A little what?
A long time.
Unlikely.
Please...
Only one I can think of.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
Playing hooky again?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
A toy?
What happens if you level with her?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
I want you on call here.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Whoa... she is a killer.
We've got to take this slow...
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
Any luck?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Jam, listen up.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Ahh, sunshine.
They're not idiots.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
When can I squeeze one out?
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
How old is Grandma Death?
Hey...
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
You're weird.
That was a compliment.
Where are you going?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
They suspended me for two days.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
My mom is gone.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Come with me.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Grandma Death.
So how was school today?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Where are you going?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Cellar door.
I think he saved my life.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
How many times have you seen Frank?
A sign from whom?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
That I did it again.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
I think now that he might...
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
How much are they paying you to be here?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
What?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Rose.
Kitty...
There's no rule!
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Amber? Here.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Amber...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Mom!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Bye mom.
I hate her!
What?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Annette, just use your hand.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
I'm a mirror.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
Who to?
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Have you got a license?
What kind of a dog is he?
Half watch dog?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
My card.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
You no gotta no gun.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
That's even a greater honor.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Give me that again!
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Oh, Rufus!
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Yes.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
What happened?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You've acquired a taste for this?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
How are you feeling today?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
What is it, Treves?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Good day...!
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
Yes!
Merrick...
Righteousness for his namesake.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
...Yes potatoes... but...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
This... is my new home?
How long will I stay here?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
You did this for me?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
The workhouse.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Very smart indeed.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
What?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
I've never LOVED anybody!
We mustn't let him land!
Halfdan the Black.
But you don't realize....
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Do you believe I love you?
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But --
How do we know this is the way?
Is it night or day, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
How?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Really.
I'll tell you what...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Is there something the matter with it?
Have you done this sort of thing before?
What about the raping?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
About NOT raping you...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
"But" what?
What are you talking about?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
What's wrong with making friends?
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
You talking piffle, son?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
You must help us.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
You'll be sucked down too!
I think we should go...
Hey, you two! What's going on?
ROW!
Bye, Leif.
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
Vanish into thin air?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
Well! Come on!
Get away, Snorri.
Together we stand!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
It's a tradition.
I must KILL! Kill!
There is nothing we can do...
He drove me mad!
Well... I'm game.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And you've got BOTH axes?
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
And I just liked you so much.
Ms. Kruczynski?
You rat.
Oh, Tangerine.
Why what?
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It's okay.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
It's pretty.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Ready for another?
You just say. I'm not really --
Well, I should probably get going.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
You should stay.
Let's talk about it later.
What?!
More?
There's this guy!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
I scoured the city for it.
It's very late.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
Probably.
Hi there.
You know what I did.
Oh God, how horrid.
I think, before.
Cool.
I knew.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Bye, Joel.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
What took you so long?
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Yeah?
It's true.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
How's it going?
I just got in.
I might be making a mistake.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
So then she just stops calling.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I'm sorry.
Definitely!
Boo.
See you later, alligator.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Hey.
I know what it is.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Okay, we're back in.
We can't do this.
What, Howard?
You made me have an abortion.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
For magazines?
So now you're bummin' around?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Time to play Spam in the can.
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
Coffee.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
How? The Bridge is gone.
Can you shut it down?
What's wrong?
90 over 50 and falling... .
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
You're not seriously considering sending him?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Patch me through to him.
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
Peters is right, no one's here.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I found one.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
Explanation?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Your eyes...
What are you talking about?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
It is now.  We're locked in.
Thank you.
Skipper...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Miller...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
I'm on my way, Starck.
First time in a grav couch?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
The shields on the station should protect us.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
I though we went over this.
He's not responsive --
Back it down, Johnny!
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Then what is it?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can... make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this?
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
What are you doing?
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I can't find it, mon!
On the ledge?
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Hi, Brad.
Is everything okay at work?
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
What's wrong?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Did you get her number?
I would. Yeah.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're losing it, Damone.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
He is.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
So what did you do?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Well I never did it.
Was it great?
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
It couldn't be.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I paid for it and everything.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
You just ripped my card in two!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
What's that?
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Thanks for picking me up.
It's very warm out tonight.
I think I better take you home.
You keep them.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Where's your brother?
What's April 16th?
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Rum and ice, please.
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
What happened? What did they do to her?
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
That's what gives me The Fear.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Can we make it?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
What tape?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
I want that fucking radio!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
WELL? What are your plans?
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
What is this?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
The airport is over there!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
What?
Well, it don't look pretty.
Stop it.
We shot a skunk.
I think I know where a CB is.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
We just smeared a skunk.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Ohhh.
Your brother, huh?
Your parents of relation?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What is this?
Really?
Will I go crazy or something?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Huh?
What?
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
Open?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Welcome back.
Fine, Chief.
SHIT.
HELP MEEE!
Okay, well that's something.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Let's go!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Are you lying to me?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Good, good. Give them that.
Hello, Harold.
Who?
A rich actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
What do I do, Dad?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Bread?
Name?
Age?
Just one minute...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Whattaya mean?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Frances...
How ya doin', Farmer?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Serious, huh?
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Oh my God, I look awful.
You know something, Harry?
Frances! Frances!
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
I don't know.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
'But how do I know you love me?'
How's it sound?
But they're using you!
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
How long will you be?
Say you promise.
Where are you going?
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Oh! Are you really?
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Symington says...
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
What can I do?
What is this?
You will honor your promise to me!
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Nothing. Still nothing.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
What does it say?
Smell the air. Wonderful.
This feels... incestuous.
I wish to be your wife.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I give you my soul...
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor!
It's going to ram us.
No. But someday.
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
I have always loved him.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Paracelsus?
What is your name?
Professor Waldman.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Do you share my madness?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
We should go now.
What'd you see?
Cabin B is ready.
You want to leave?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
You can only do what you can do.
How the... did he get in there?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What's the matter with it?
How come?
I'm sorry.
Ha!
Ow!
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
What about Neddy?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Are you wet?
Best over...
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
I mean...
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Yeah, follow us.
Why do you want to stop?
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Where is the little lady?
How'd she die?
Died instantly?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Why not, against your religion?
He backed down.
Now, is your shit together?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
I promise.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
That happens, you'll get it back.
What?
We have to go back for Daddy!
-- you got your sink --
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
I never said help us!
Best in Mexico.
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Richard!
This ain't the time, Richard.
I don't know, you just passed out.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
That's what you think?
I'm lookin' scared?
How?
What do you mean?
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Got it.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Of course, but there's more --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
No, sir, WHAT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
See me, sir?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Yes?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Hardly the case, Senator.
"The Lark Report."
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
O'Neil?
Time.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Chances of recovery?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
So why are you telling me this?
No shortage of suspects.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Do you?
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
This ain't workin' right!
Thought you two were file-closed.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Who the hell are all these people?
I like that image.
He stole my report! That's my report!
Yeah. Why are you asking?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
What are you doing here?
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Your old sweetheart?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Hence the radiation.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Who the hell are you?
This is it?
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
We've got to stop!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Oh my god, It's real.
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Hi Brandon.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
... Yes?
What do you mean?
But you don't?
Go. They're off again.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Systems register functional.
... What does that mean?
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
No, I'll kill you. .
How do you remember this stuff?
THAT'S why you built this ship?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
They're still behind us...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Hi everybody.
More to the left... Stay parallel...
What?
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Hey... Hey where are you going?
There's nobody here. Jason...
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Clenched jaw...
What?  What did he say?
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We pretend...
We.. We lie.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Where?
Anything.
Okay... On what?
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Arnold!
Is that a fact.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Misunderstood what!?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Makes you gag.
Oh, come now...
You think that?
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Martha... what?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
George, you know I only love you, but...
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You get life for kidnapping.
And that's for the airport.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
About sixty.
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Karen? You okay?
She's great. Gimme the money.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
I don't know.
How'd you get in here?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You have a card in here?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
So he comes to L.A...
You mean, Leo?
What does that mean?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
For a movie?
What's it called?
Just a thought.
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
It was in the Herald.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
We talk different?
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
I'm thinking of a movie.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
How about this?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
What's that?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
How? By taking my money?
The door from the patio, in back.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
I don't know.
You don't act like it?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
He already knew it.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
What a spectacular view.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
How did you get in the house?
Which two?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
What? You sure?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
What's so great about Sweden?
What is your first name?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Did you?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
What's this?
Goddamit, Dodge.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
That'd be my guess.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
The radio!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
What the hell happened!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Don't fall asleep.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
You mean, before she sank.
That's a good thing?
Coffee.
Any dizziness?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
Who?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
How's he doing?
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
Nope.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
What happened?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Let the buyer beware.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Yeah.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Morning.
I heard that.
Oh, man.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
We're still drifting.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Give up?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Jesus, look at this guy.
No.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Okay... I promise.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Since when is she an "actress"?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Why?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Hi, Al!
So what should we do?
What is this?
Hey - why do you have this?
Look, that's back when I hated you.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
Ew, look at this...
Just promise you'll do it.
It's a surprise.
Give me all your money, bitch!
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
That rules!
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
No, really...
Look, we have to get these...
Don't you want nice stuff?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
There.
I dunno...
We're not.
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
...are you waiting for a bus?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
That's five hundred dollars.
Five hundred.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Every guy has a type!
So is that your boyfriend?
So, why did you bring this along?
Yes, that would certainly do...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
What, like a girdle?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
Uh... sure... come in.
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Please Josh?
I agree.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
What do you mean?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
You were contracted to work-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
You've never built in Africa.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Don't much like them.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What a good week.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Good luck.
I am also liaison between these two.
He has children?
Where is it?
Afraid of lions.
Why so many?
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Oh no.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
You're also a human being, Frank.
Hello, Peter.
His name is Oscar.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
Good luck.
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Maybe I should call Janine.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Can I help you?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Well, good night, Louis.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Should we go?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Then why have you come?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
You've got to do something!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Can I have some of your water?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
So far so good.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Is the line sinking?
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Ready?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Aren't you glad we waited?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
You really don't act like a scientist.
Damn!
I think I should spend the night here.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Do you want this body?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
What's that got to do with it?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Circle?
Nervous?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Where's the Keymaster?
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Who?
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Set entry grid.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What do you mean by "seen?"
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
For the gods, spit it out!
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
So am I.
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Servis made it through again?
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
What about their philosophy lessons?
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
You get to come alive again in the country!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
Will you take me home now?
I think I'd better go home now please.
We won't. Let's go inside.
What is the matter?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin --
Do you?
Did they ever find out?
Elaine --
I'm meeting someone.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Well, I want you to leave.
Let me go.
What are you looking for?
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
You really will?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Ben.
What are you then?
What for?
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Hello.
Where are you?
Can I help you, sir!
Is anything wrong, sir?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
How are you, Benjamin?
Is it a girl?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Will you come in, please?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you think?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Thank you.
Don't be nervous.
May I sit down?
How are you?
I got a single room.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
To tell you?
Thank you.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Oh my God.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Oh.
Do you want to hear it or not?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
How do you get out of the house?
We're talking.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Man, is this interesting.
What?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
And you were a student also.
What was your major?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Really. I want to know.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
What are you doing?
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
What have you done to her?
No -- actually I'm not --
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Oh, no.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I do.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well --
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
I know.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Hello.
Now look -- please --
No, I don't.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Hello.
Turn 'em up.
No -- no -- no -- no...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I've quit.
Like dancing?
You?
Reducing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Too bad.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
I'd given you up.
That was lovely.
Going?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I want to be alone --
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
What can you see?
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
So --
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
Till then.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Ready, Kringelein?
All right then.
That was my last.
I take five hundred.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Well -- last night was not so good.
The war.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
For me?
And the child isn't coming?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Telegrams?
Any letters?
Oh!
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm engaged for the evening.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
No - absinthe.
Really?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Yes, of course, -- money!
Am I!
You...
What brown hands you have.
No.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Of course -- of course. 
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
You see -- what we are interested in --
You're a deep one.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Just one moment, sir.
We will wait.
Four minutes past. Please come.
No. No word.
I know -- I know.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What's bluff?
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Not much time.
Here you are! Two rich people!
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Sounds like a good Idea.
Well, uh... No.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Don't mention it.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I just came back from Phoenix.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I didn't teach you that.
I can't. I just left home.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Her job.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
He retired.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Think about it. Okay?
Yeah?
You -- I don't know.
You were gone for a while.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
That's what I say.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
I'll be damned.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit?!
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
I'm not leaving without her.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Not me.
I can see that.  Why?
You really think Eddie killed her?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
What are you looking at?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Keri, you all right?
Ooooh, busted.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Mom -- Who is this?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
No!!!
What do you know about Michael?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
We've never met.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home is important to a man.
No.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
Could have happened to anybody.
What's funny about that?
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Hi, Penelope.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Hello.
I wanted to apologize.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What an awful sound!
What went wrong?
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're my buddy.
Sir?
You were about to ask a question?
Life has denied me that thrill.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Excellent!
It makes life spicy.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
I'm a man.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Eighteen--  and a half.
You don't even know me.
How do you do?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
What's that all about?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
I have some change!
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Why not?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I feel the same way.  What next?
You have chills?
Pacqualinincheewa root.
There's a certain amount of information there.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm an honorable clown?
You hope.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I see.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
The new hero is you.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Don't shoot.
No.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
For what?
Who's dead?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
A lot of people don't.
I don't really know.
Where will you be?
Mom?
That's why I'm crying.
Everything stays as it is!
My father!
He isn't?
I'm touched.
Is he all right?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
What was it?
Possibly.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
You were wonderful.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
We made the date three months ago.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
This is very good for us.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
Yeah.
I just want to ask some questions.
What?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Are you sure it's all right?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
The other girl is the star?
No.
Where is she?
Where's he?
Are you a private detective?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Up front?
When do we start?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
And your wife? Where's she?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
How important do you think sex is?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I can stop if you want.
It's not quite the same thing.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
They are the same.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Andy.
Mast?
In G.R.? Why?
I've got a meeting...
I don't know.
They're legal now.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Wes, do me a favor.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
It's a short film.
But I...
I thought you were a businessman.
Hold it, mister.
What's that?
Com'on, tell me.
What does that do?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
To his own daughter?
You can fuck off, too.
Jake'll take care of me.
You are at the University, Candy?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Your tree.
Haven't we met before?
We planted it.
No.
Check.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Yes.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Sort of.
How about some ginger pie?
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why do you say that?
What happened?
What?
What is it?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Oh, my. We're too late.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Okay?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Did Confucius say that?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
With God?
Maude, I must speak to you.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
You should have been a poet.
- end where I began.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
"And this too shall pass away."
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
I'm getting married.
How do you do?
And why is that?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Your classmates?
What would you say?
The moment of truth.
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Stay where you are, Harold .
You knew?
He... he loved me.
She's done it.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The box. I need the box.
I've got to finish it.
I'm scared.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
He talked about Demons, huh?
Who?
The freak in the gas mask --
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Well, you did break out --
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
Each of us gets a belt.
-- should go back. Now!
What took you so long?
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
It's freezing, isn't it?
That you feel that way about me.
Hello, I'm --
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
This isn't for real.
Many times.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
We've got such sights to show you --
Julia!
What about Larry --
Don't look at me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Later.
A long time.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
So where's the harm?
She'll tell them everything...
Well we can't just stay here --
There's a towel in the bathroom.
This afternoon.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
Larry!
Well?
You're NOT going to faint.
Take it slowly.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Maybe a brandy.
Larry...
Huh?
Drinking alone.
I suppose that's right.
Well, isn't it?
I suppose not.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
You wouldn't believe me.
Where are you?
Great.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Get the fuck out of here.
Need any help?
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I see.
Meaning what?
I beg your pardon?
Steve. Thank God you came.
Play it.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Why would they care?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
The little skate-fuckers.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Why not?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Well what about the new Echo --
That's what I said.
Uh.  That's me.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
What's this?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob.
Can I do anything?
What is this.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Are you coming home?
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Yeah.  Great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
So, how are you?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
I'm sorry.
Me?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Let's go home.  Okay?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Just local, of course.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Which way are you going?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Thirteen hundred.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Happy birthday.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
It's not mine.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good reflexes.
Grave robbers?
Why not?
He tried to kill me last night.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.
You did kill those men.
You want me to front for you.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I hope I never get that old.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I'm not even sure why.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
He is older than I.
Not the same.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Get out.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Be quiet.
Afternoon.
Aye.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Aye.
I was driven out.
How can you know this?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
I don't understand.
It is the truth.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Some think not.
Who am I deceiving?
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Equals?
Don't threaten me, Private.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
My father taught me.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Where!
How are you?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
He found us even there.
We have some unfinished business.
My condolences.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
Morning Mr. North
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I'll keep you in mind.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
But --
What's the matter?
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Hildy!
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Ts! Ts! Ts!
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Sure you can. Come on.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Sweeney.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Allow me.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
What now?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
There's money in it, Cooley.
Let's see the money.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I call. What you got?
Open up there, will you!
Hey!
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
So have we!
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
Gus, this --
He's harmless.
What went off?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
No -- don't out me off.
Shoot to kill, I said.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Where's the old lady?
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
You fight it cut.
Hiding him where?
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
What good'll it do?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
What's he want?
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
You want to join our gang?
Sod.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You wouldn't.
I did see them. I did.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Where?
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Why not?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
No Turks.
And what's that?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
What is it, pet?
Now take deep breaths, and push.
It was the best time of his life.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Molly!
Cone.
Who's your Daddy!
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Wondering what?
What the hell are you laughing about?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
What's this?
The Duke?
But suppose for a second you did.
She's pretty cute.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Perfect.
She looks like she stinks.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Just grin and bear it.
Should we stop?
Hey, he moved.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Fine. I'll go straight.
Check this out.
Drive through it!
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Why?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
What was that?
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Thank you.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
I guess not.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Is everything fine?
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
What is wrong, my darling?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
I've moved on.
You were wonderful!
Lila?
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
My apologies, madam.
Nice night.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
So?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Oh?
How'd you know where I was?
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
I'm going to miss you.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You really enjoy my company?
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Come on.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I think he's ready.
You were gone a long time.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Oh boy!
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you, Nate.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Boys just passing through?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
You bastard.
We'll be there.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm buyin'.
Only when I work.
Poker's not your game.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
That's your problem.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Here, I got it.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
They're fine.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Please don't get off me now.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Well, here it's half.
Yeah, that's right.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
You quittin' too?
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
You better not miss, friend.
You quittin', friend?
What time does the bus leave?
Hey!
Why did you do that?
Why?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eddie, what's in that case?
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
No. You?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
You glad?
No, I want to walk.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Are you all right?
How much do you remember?
Do you remember where you lived?
What about... now?
Yes.
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What do you want?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
You and that damned garden.
Hell of a night.
Bathroom?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
What's that, Dad?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
There are more this year than last.
Are you all right, Dad?
What happened to you?  Who was that?
Where's your car?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Mr. Gardner, I --
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
What is it?
Don't go in.
George, where have you been?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
What do you want?
What do you want me to do?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Just my luck, no ice.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Love was never our problem.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Perfect, she's using it.
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
This I can see.
Thanks, Pops.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Any news on my wife?
How're we doing?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Where's it headed?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
With their shields down it might be possible.
Dick-weed!
You scared the hell out of me.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
But I gave you some this morning.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
What the hell's going on?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
May we go home now, please?
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Henry, the pen --
Tapestries?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
You could be more right than you know.
I usually don't either.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
It must be one of these...
What do you know about this place?
But what are you doing here?
I'll never forgive myself --
Found it.
Well, what was left of him.
Rats?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
What am I looking for?
I ought to tell you something.
The floor's on fire! See?!
What?
This is intolerable!
My Diary's in Berlin.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Well... I can't think of anything.
I don't need camels.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Who are you?
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
I ride with you, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Come one, what's wrong?
Let up on the brake!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You will go to palace there.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
You all right?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
He's afraid of something.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Not leftovers?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Oh no -- oh no!!
What?!
A fulcrum release lever!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
It's okay. You're all right now.
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Anymore ideas...?
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
I said something.
Who was it?
You're in my head...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Yeah...Who?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
What are you doing?
You're not crazy.
What was that?
No they won't.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
I want out.
I don't like the sound of that.
Now what.
Just walk down the hall?
A lab and equipment.
What about money?
It's illegal.
I'll get in trouble.
It's just not enough.
The beach?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
It's sand.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
She doesn't seem to understand.
Which language?
What do I do?
Touch her.
...Joe.
Without your pants.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Which one is she?
What Happened?
Come on, she's getting away.
Where are you going?
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Don't touch a thing.
Ow!
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I don't trust her.
Left...The one with the red dot.
There's a lot you don't know.
Sorry...
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
I knew you were trouble.
In him?
What Job?
What are you doing here, where've you been?
It is to me too.
It may have been affected.
You may not remember things.
Don't you want to get out?
Joe.
Ahhh...nothing.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
What?
Then who did?
Is someone else here?
Let you leave without it.
What's so funny?
I waited for you.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
I'm leaving too.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
Now what?
Where what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Why'd you ask him.
I know the territory.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What happened?
Are you alright?
What did you tell them?
Now what?
What?
He can't help us.
Come on.
Riuji?
Excuse me?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
It's alright.
The other working.
It will.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
It'l take months.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Yeah.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
We gotta hook up.
When's your deadline?
What does that do?
I don't know what he was thinking.
When's the air date?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
So, what are you going to do?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
And what are you implying?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is my gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Mike... Mike... Mike...
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Come again?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Jeffrey Wigand...
I got perspective.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Is it too late?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah, I'm here.
We're there.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Thank you for saying that...
Lowell.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
What do...
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Good. But Jeff...
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
What about now?
What are you talking about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
So she's uh, flourishing?
No!
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
That's his lawyer.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Why in God's name would I want...?
It was a gift from a client.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marylin! What have I done?
You like kids.
I begged you to have a baby!
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
These are yours.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? When did I say...?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I don't have a ring!
But?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
I fell in love Miles.
It's a no go, Joe.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Do you know him?
Who's she?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
You're not...
So what?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Wait. I know you.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Mr. Massey --
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Where does that leave us?
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Ah.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Wrigley!
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you think?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
What ten thousand?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
What's this about not eating?
You ought to know why. Because—
Where are you taking me?
South America!
What've you got against King Westley?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Oh, come now—
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Peter Warne! 
Oh, no—no.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
What do you think you're doing!
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, yeah?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Nope. No complaints.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks, professor.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Yeah.
This isn't "piggy-back."
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Peter—
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
What's got into you?
Sure.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
What'd you give him for the car?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I hope you got your money.
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
I've been thinking about you.
The dame's too smart for him.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
You're drunk.
Who's she gonna marry?
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
What?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
A trumpet?
Send it collect.
I can use a smart guy like you.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Right.
What was his voice like?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Bill.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Why?  What's wrong?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Then who killed the President?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
No.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
That's our case!
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
...you heard echoes.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
No.
Who?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Did they live?
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Get a hold of yourself.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
What's wrong, Lou?
Can we find her?
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Time?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
You know who the mayor was?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
It never did. 
You have other information?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Why were you with him?
How'd you know where he was?
You got a good lawyer?
We are. Don't worry about it.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
What's this?
But now you're telling us now you do.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's the one who wants you.
With ten thousand? Nine.
If you're having some.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Want to hear some music?
This is pretty.
'76?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
How'd you feel about it?
My ass ain't the same.
How old's Annette?
Will Ordell go for that?
You're avoiding the question.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Uh-huh.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
He's already there.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Who's side are you on?
Yes'm.
He say is a surprise.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
Oh, so now you know him?
How can you help us?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
She didn't say.
Ever been tempted?
Where's the bag she gave you?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I'm waiting for the phone.
How long you been with Ordell?
He said he didn't know about it.
You already knew that?
Are you getting that black suit?
It looks good on you.
For what?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Yeah?
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
If you want.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
What for?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Were you a disco girl?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
As low as two.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Yeah.
I didn't look like a bum.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
It's Louis.
Couldn't talk to her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
They don't have your winning personality.
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Comfortable?
Somebody already did.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
What's up with this shit.
You know who this is?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
That's all?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Uh-huh.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
Dream on!
You know, you got a strange line here.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
What are you talking about?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
They stole it.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Jake, is that you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Who? Jed?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
What?
What do you mean you can see?
Jake!
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
Why? What for?
What'd the doctor say?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
He said you didn't have one.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's going on?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I can't move.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
You got a nice tan, though.
He's burning up.
Push 'em back.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Still married, Jake?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
I just need to talk.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Everywhere, like a plague.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Goodbye old friend.
What are you doing?!!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Can't shut em' down from here.
You see that?
Kay-Em!
Get them in the lab!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Yllo, what's your head count?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Jesus, God!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where are you going?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
What if you miss?
I couldn't save them.
Did you like it?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
It's time.
Kaboom.
I...I don't know what I did...
Now that's just gross.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Barbie from hell...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
I didn't say I was good at it.
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
Kay-em you okay?
Something's wrong.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'm sending you the files.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Yes!
Can we get through these?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's trying to sink us!
Probably out in the back yard.
Be careful.
Love ya.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Got a pen on you?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I hope we get some more help.
Quint...?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
One more after this, then I'm going home.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Look at him take it!
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
What's that supposed to prove?
Coming right to us!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
You know how I feel about her.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
So, what do you think we should do?
Whose idea was it?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Okay, cool.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
We could get back together too.
I don't like Katrina.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
We're getting a stretch limo.
I still have your virginity!
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Why?
Just like our moms and teachers!
What a trip, man.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Nails? Really?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Cool it.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
When was this, like '96?
Like what?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Hello?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Cute?
Oh, okay. Like this.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Then what's going on?
Is the baby okay?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
No...
Juno? What's going on?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Excuse me?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
What do you make with that?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Juno, what's the matter?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
Have you found a place to stay?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Hi, I'm Adele.
Are you takin' the pictures?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
Happy birthday Adele.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, what're you doin'?
...I don't know.
What's your name, boy?
Where you from Walter?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Henry Lucas.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
...and?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Carrie.
What is it?
There's more...
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Early, just think...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
...Diebold?
Yes. Altogether.
What do you think?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You got any money?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
That.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So really, it's good luck.
How much you gonna take?
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Where you at?
Sup then? Sup?
Yeah. Come on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Do you like kissing me?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
What is it?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
You still mad at him?
You didn't?
I hate sucking dick!
Wish me luck.
I'm coming.
What happened?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
And you don't get shit out of it.
Oh shit.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Hello?
Hello?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Slow.
Yeah.
Casual.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Morpheus.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
You're a lying bastard!
Yes you are.
What are you talking about?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
What do you think?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
What is it?
A few people.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Just for that no hint today.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
What?
What word did you leave last night?
Please... wait.
It's me you want.  Not her.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
What's this?
No problem.  We're in.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
What is it?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
You might not have done it had you known.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
I know he really likes you.
Congratulations, dad.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
You mean, no prints but hers?
Well?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I'm busy right now.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
As large as castles.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
I can check and call you back.
Bainbridge Books.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Is this your first time here?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
Do you always open quickly?
They couldn't break the riddle.
We need your help.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
Do you?
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It was.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Did you call?
Nothing.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Why?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You have not slept in two days.
You choose these?
I can't reach her.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
The spiral begins in the west.
How did you know?
They can be saddled.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Let me comfort you.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
My <u>friend</u>.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Well, I'm not impressed.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
He will come for me.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Modred! Impossible!
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The new King.
It is the time.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Each to his fate, lad.
Look.
Kegan!
Who speaks that name!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
But you would not stay with me.
You had a son.
Do not try your trickery on me!
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
...You don't believe me, don't you?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
May I ask you a personal question?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
How are you, Miss?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...OK... Good.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
I don't accept that.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Are you two planning kids?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
So what's the deal Maurice?
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
What it is -- is the truth.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
There's no reason.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Maurice?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
To where?
From where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Doubts?  About what?
Well, hello.
I thought you were asleep.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
Where?
Phileas Fogg?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Tom Joad?
Come on Mr. Parker.
What do your friends call you?
... My father.
Sparkling apple cider?
Sarah -- with an H?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Don't run away.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
This is the home of an angel.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Yes.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera... what you don't understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
What do you mean?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Your color.
Thank you, Sera.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I like it here with you.
There are limits.
You know I love you... yeah?
How'd this happen?
About ready for another drink?
Where are you staying?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Harvard Law School?
I loved him!
Were you with another man?
I'll take that as a no.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
No!
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Where you got in the shower.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I'm sorry?
Yes?
You can't even imagine.
Is she?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
The idiot speaks.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Too demure?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Josh proposed!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Good luck.
Why?
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
I can't.
Whoa -- Why?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
How could this happen?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Almost.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
What?
What're you doing here?!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
You're beautiful.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You got into Harvard Law?
You look -- nice.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
We come watch... we come watch...
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
You... you're a beast!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
No... I... I need to rest.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
This is ogre's magic.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Wait, Jack.
Can we trust him?
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
One more turn...
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
A good day for singing...
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
We seek to undo the curse.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
I detest serpents.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Where are you going?
What happened?
He did run?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Tis the truth.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
No!  I won't let it happen...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
What's this now?
What became of the princess?
This is sad news, be it true.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I'd be honored.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Wondrously so.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Please...
What do we do now?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Hello, Jack.
Uhm... fine work.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
What are you doing up so early?
Atonement.
Are you his friend?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Huh?
Really?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Josh said...
You hate your father.
I don't wanna go.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
I have the permit.
That would take weeks.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Is Alyssa home?
I don't know.
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Where is it?
Did you got through my pants?
You can't make me do a thing.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Hi, Alyssa.
I know parts of who you are.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I gave up on you.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
What would you do?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
God, you look like crap, George.
What?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I love those doors.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
George --
It makes me sad.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Finished or unfinished?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
You brought your kids?
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Peter left me yesterday.
I could die.
Been thinking?
He said he heard hammering.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
What are you doing in my room?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
Go tell your father we're eating.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yeah.
Why not?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Can't you remember your own name?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
That's some long green.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
I said you're soft.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
So?
You still got that map?
No.
Don't mention it.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
Crawfords.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
I can't eat this.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
You got your own nightclub?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
You mean Louis Armstrong?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
What are you doing here, mama?
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Appreciate it.
What are you in for, Willie?
Where'd you get this?
ADRIAN!
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
I'll call her later.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
How come you're not older?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Did you just talk?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Hey...
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Easy, Liberace.
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Please. You got to.
You gotta kill yourself.
You think I'm a tourist?
The South.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
What were you thinking coming here?
I think I'm floating.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Don't do it.
Off limits.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Answer the question!
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Why?
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Who invited you?
What's going on, Logan?!
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
And?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't..
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
If you did know, you'd tell me.
I'd rather be with you.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I -- I can't.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
What's that?
Don't ever let go.
What does it mean?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
How did you get here?
Are there any other humans?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
What a fuckin' job.
He'll kill us.
I don't know.
So, should I call Andy?
You got him.
Where's the bathroom?
The police called us.
Sheila?
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Where's Pete?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Where is he now?
You just gonna let him go?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
He's not Madison?
I won't ever tailgate.
There's no other bedroom?
What is it?
We've met before, haven't we?
At your house.
Where's Alice?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Same one you were reading the other night?
I had a dream about you last night...
You're up early.
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Last time I saw you.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
What do you want?
Hey... Sheila.
All of it?
Yes, sir.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Sorry.
I see.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
He might have lost his way.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Have I?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
There you are!
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Cave, eh? Where?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Goodness, no!
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
When was all this?
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Charming, isn't she?
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
You're lying, aren't you?
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
What are these people?
He's dead.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Did I say "if"?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Let me up! Let me up!
You can't take her away from here!
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
Where were you hiding?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Yes.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Thank you.
I'm thirty.
What is?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Why, he's speaking English.
You'll wait till you rot!
EXCUSE ME–
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
The hell were you thinking?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
They don't?
Only the damn guy won't know it.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
what's this?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
What's going on, Kay?
The radio show?
Jesus...
How does that help me?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So... how'd you hear about this?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
What do we do?
Yeah ... ?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Nowhere.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Kay?  What's your 20?
They're gone.
Actually, I don't know...
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
What?
What?
I can't.  I have to know.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Just some guy... they found.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
You the sentry?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lara called me.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
Uh, sir...
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Somewhere near the capital?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
She was looking right at me.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
Okay... now let me time you.
I wanted to.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Let go of the gun.
Something wrong?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Then how did he --
Who?
I understand.
Congratulations, sir.
How did you get this?
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Lamar, I found something.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Can't they shut that off?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
It's on West Broadway.
So, wait, you're from where?
What the fuck was that about?
It's daytime.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I don't know.
No.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Take her.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Yeah.
When's it going down?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Where we going?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Yes.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
No. Just the cross streets.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Yeah?
Can you check?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you with the number.
Fuck them.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
I like it.
Nice work.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Yeah. What vibe?
He woulda told us right?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
The penguin house.
We need guns.
You did?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
You want to come splash around.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Yes?
Yes?
Excuse me.
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
See you later.
Ow, shit...
No, really, mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
Yeah.
Nah, man...
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
You know my pager number?
Sure. You boys want anything?
Can I borrow a piece of --
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
No. I'll take a strega.
Yeah.
Scotland.
I am.
Dip?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Where can I get a hold of you?
How's it feel?
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Let Billie finish.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
What you say?
Who the hell are you?
Man, what do you want?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
The body is a holy repository.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
I'll have it tomorrow.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
Could we sit down someplace?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I'll be away a lot.
Why are you looking at me like that?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
If you want to tell me.
Can I ask you something?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
She know?
Let's go.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
How many you turning out?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Another one?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
That's a fine chick.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
[Daniel.]
[How does it work?]
[Drive.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
What is it?
How does it affect you?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Yeah, right...
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
You mean a misfire?
Creasy?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Potential? I don't understand.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Did you like school, Creasy?
And don't start crying.
Well, I let him go.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
You're late.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
[You have the money.]
Yes, mom?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Bye, Mom.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
I think it's nice he's American.
She likes him.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
You helped him get this job.
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
I'll call her up.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
I don't think I remember him.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Ufa!
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
You come up here often?
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Are you kidding?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Don't worry about it.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
What?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
So these two girls come over to the bar...
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Well...
On accounta...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Tommy!
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Stop him! Stop that man!
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Where?
Which hospital?
Don't you use olives?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
I have a tent to myself.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
You betcher ass, Dad.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Black capsule.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
For you, Trapper.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
He only lasted one season.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Yes!
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Who?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Better let me talk to him.
Hello?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
You made it up.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Hurry up, Pop.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Colonel!
Had any schooling?
What do you do when you work?
What do they want?
Help yourself.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Ba-ll!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
You don't have to—Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Sure, you are.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Four bits.
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Sure.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
What are you doing up here then?
What's your name?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Oh!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
They're not usually graduate students.
No -- you can't do that.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
What's the line?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Could I please have a little water?
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Manual or automatic?
That's right.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
For now that's all.
It's all there.
How do you feel after a shooting.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
You'd never been out of New York?
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Tell me what you need.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
The 6 horse is still last.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's already started.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Korda escaped.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Hmm?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
Scott...
Tell him to give me a raise.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
The car is part of the deal.
I can't do that.
Roper...
Any verification on numbers.
What do you want?
What do you need?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
She said I have a son...
It's all here...
It's time to wake up.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
The new world.
You sure he's going to come?
But what if he doesn't --
Where you plugged-in from?
What's her name?
Won't be time if he gets access --
He had access to the keys --
What is it?
What did he tell you?
Not his style.
Then you had her killed.
I've got to get back.
You said we were on the same programming team.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
And it meant something.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Access granted.  Male or female?
We've got him locked!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
I can hardly walk...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
Release the power WITH the power.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Let's go after him!!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
And how do we do that?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Anybody see them?
You own a hotel, sir?
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The goddamned bastards.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
What do you mean?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
I got my partner in there!
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Four-twenty-eight.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
No. They envy you.
Something came up.
You could have stopped him.
Charlie?
Charlie!
Meyer.
Like Don Maranzano.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
This business is about taking risks.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Not stupid. Fat.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
We learn from life.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
The terms will be mine.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Take any one ya like.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
What's the matter?
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Bitchin' good cake.
What are you watching?
I might wake up.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Hypnos?
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Mother, I ...
What's wrong?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Really?
What happened?
He's an organic farmer.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Where to?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Positively not in the station! Gone!
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
My first name's--Clarissa.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
The war's on!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Dinner, Hubert.
He's batty!
Oh--oh.
One minute! Just one minute!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
What!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Will the Senator yield?
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Please, sir!--come with me!
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Whose statue is that?
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
A *day*!
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Yes, yes--
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
You--don't know it, do you?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
A camp! Well!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
What! Who?
Joe! You *told* him to!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Yeah?  And what else?
Why don't you do it yourself?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
What do you think?
You won't stand for it?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Most every day.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Any children?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
You are , aren't you?
What?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Here's a nice place.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Well, here we are again.
Good night.
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
When're you going to see him again?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Yes, but you said—
You try it.
Fourteen carat?
Stuff, sir?
He's not home, I tell you!
Thank heaven.
He's what?
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
How do you do.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Let him alone.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Well, I don't know. I—
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
What is your name?
South Dakota - north?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Tails tonight, sir?
No, sir.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Hey, did you hear that?
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
What an asshole!
Thank you.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Why? I'm paying for this.
No?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
What do you want to know?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Hello, Lionel.
But you know how to drive?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Ph.D., psychologist.
Finally, some common sense...
Well, look who's here...
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
What would you do?
I'm not making any promises.
Is this the treatment?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Which thing?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Mother...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
In maybe three or four issues.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
What did he want you to do?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Lily.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Where's your new friend?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
What just happened?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
No women allowed.
No?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
You two!
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
You called me your girl?
Got it!
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Juicy?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Tough break.
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
I thought you were done?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
Much less go outside.
Who are you?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
How's your dad?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
That boy's got talent.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Come here.
Who?
Or talk?
Hi.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
I'm going inside.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
You're the Sphinx.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
So what else has Superman got?
Or flowers.
Maybe she's right.
Sounds good.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
And a social life.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
That was too close.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
What do you mean?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
General Bonaparte?
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Hello there, Picart.
How did it spread so quickly?
And he sent you to me?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Thank you, Napoleon.
Good evening, sir.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
When is she supposed to return?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were they pretty?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Separate bedrooms?
I believe you sent for me.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
You could hear them?
You mean you heard them making love?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Come in.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Who are you?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
What you mean talk to her?
Naw, I already ate.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Fuck, what's his name?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
What?
Damn, you got a stalker.
You know what this is?
$247.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Delivery!
Delivery!
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
What kind of activity?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
What?!  What that mean?
Hey, what's going on?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Need to lose some weight.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Huh?
Mr. Nasty time?
This? I've never even fired one.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Come with us, sir.
Daddy?
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
You're out of your mind.
What...?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
I think you better put that away.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Lynn!
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
You got anything smaller?
You remember me?
Oh, Jesus ...
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Keep the change.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
I'm not a baby.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
Foreigners! Fuck!
And what happens if I don't call you?
Any trouble?
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
AAA-MENN!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
What?
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Amen! Amen!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Why?
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
You swore, Pearl!
Pearl! You ain't --
To see Dad?
Don't you hurt her!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What's taking you so long about it?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Now it's your turn.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
What's their names?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Harry!
Do you want more children, Willa?
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Them kids is yours?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
This man down at the Drugstore...
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
You believe in anything?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Yeah. So?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
The killer.
What!?
How you doing, pal?
He's dangerous.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Did you sleep?
You okay?
Screw sleep!
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
You feel better now, right?
Bring me forty-five back.
From Leon.
Good evening, Anna.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Well, a hat...
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You want this?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
What a lovely room you have here.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Good evening, Gaston.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Yes, Leon...
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What proposition?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Private.
Confess what?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
How long do we have to wait here?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Is that customary?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
I must go.
As a representative of Moscow...
Then do it through my lawyer!
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Must one always be after something?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
I wish they had never met.
Not funny, huh?
It's nine o'clock.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Radio! What is radio?
What shall we get? The news!
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Is this the wish of the masses?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Oh, Leon!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Yes, Swana, you did.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Now, please, Swana.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Where are they?
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Good morning, Comrade.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
At Père Mathieu's.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
We could check the tape again, sir.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
How's the job coming, Bob?
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
How much do you need?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I understand that, sir.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
It's a code or something.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
And?
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
No, you didn't, Bob.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Fucking hell.
Well, why not?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Sir?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Mr. President!
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
What'd you say?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
Thank you for coming, Dick.
I never met the man.
Who do you think is behind it?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
How the fuck did you know?
You're fucking me.
Where'd you find him?
Mein Kampf?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Bernstein.
Proud?
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
You're not a failure, Dick.
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Yeah ... I'm out.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Were you planning to tell me?
Buddy? ...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Because ... I have to relax.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Tomorrow.
It'll be over soon.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How you been, Ellis?
How come're you doin that?
Nineteen zero and nine.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
You're discouraged.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
No I ain't.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
But you don't believe it.
Probably must be.
What was the bullet?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
You gonna drive out there?
...This month's checks.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
...Be careful.
What do you think.
No.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
What're you doin', baby?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Llewelyn?
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Yessir?
...You getting anything on this?
What airport would you use.
Airport.
...I know where you are.
All right.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
How much?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Will there be anything else?
Well... I need to close now --
Yes I do.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
You already have the tent?
One room, one night.
You on all night?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Then you'll like me.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
What outfit.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
...I meant your food.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It wasn't a woman.
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Need something else?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
No... what about your sister?
I gotta go.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, you mean Fred.
Of course.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
So, call me when you --
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Dr. David Ravell.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
It's something I had to do. For David.
Guess who I saw today.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
You should have a little faith in people.
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Huh?
The fuck you talking about?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Like what?
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
What the hell was that, another statement?
I hope you're right...
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I never said that I believed...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Who's this?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
What'd you get her?
Jesus Christ!
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Yeah? The sport utility?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Did Chloe crack?
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Huh?!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
'N turned into a frog -
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Latch right on to that tit.
Suckin' away.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
It was a moment a weakness!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
...Yeah?
Daddy!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Who's that?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
What's your name, boy?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want your D.O.R.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
No, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
You're good.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
Hi, son.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Is your brother a flyer?
Vietnam?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
You're sure it's okay?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
He ask you out for next weekend?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
What did you tell him about the baby?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Want me to get a towel?
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
How do you figure that's your bunk?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
What the fuck is funny about this?
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
The walls are steel, right?
NOT THAT ONE?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Who is this guy?
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
That door is a safely hazard.
Push that button for me, will you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
Cut it back a little bit.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
Something's weird.
No, Edgar Allen.
478...
Fuck him.
Damn it!
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Morse code?
Do it.
Call Dad!
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
What if I spazz out?
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Lemme see that rifle son...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
So... we understand each other Judge?
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
What's the pig's name?
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Yeah, I do.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Fuck is up?!
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Rose?
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
When?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Am I one of that sort?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
I know that.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
We did.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Thank you.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
How old are you?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
No, I don't.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
You were an Englishman then...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
One of yours?
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
Where is he now?
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
It is ended.
Your son, what did you name him?
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Reverend.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
How many came back?
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Seventeen.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Is he really all right?
But don't you dare say that.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
I don't get it.
I'm not tired!
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Hey--they actually found the place!
God, that's fine.
I can hardly read these.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Going to tell Ellie?
Yes, but--
What say, Louis?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The movers--
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
My God!
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Getting there.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
No!  You gave your word!
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
Why don't I want to do this?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
There's ... another exit?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Do you believe him?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Why would my father send this to me?
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That was before I met one, of course.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Say again?
How did you get off the island?
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
What's your name?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Who makes all these?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Because you're a pirate.
Agreed.
It's still against the law.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Tortuga?
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
No.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
But --
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Like rotting meat.
Oh no?  Smell this.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Then you still love me?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Did you feel that?
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
I don't believe this is happening...
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Yes?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Daniel...
Somebody has to.
The big house.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Why?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Just look at it!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
Do you have something to bring me down?
What's wrong?
How far can you stretch?
What's that?
That's going to fit me?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Susie... I...
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
You!  I remember you!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
What in the hell?
I think I better go, Stew.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
May I use your telephone?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—!
I suppose you're going to print them?
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
Your place?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
You have the cutest nose I've—
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
That's an excellent idea.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
I knew your managing editor very well.
Yeah!
Thank you very much.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah, little Gloria.
It has been alleged - yes—
Is that so?
What play?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
That's a canary, sir.
That's a lovely dress.
The boss is getting hoarse.
You what?
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Thanks, thanks.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
My mistake - she's glaring.
How far have you gotten?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
What could I be?
Here you are.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Traps shut!
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
And you struck him right here in our house—?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
It's okay. It's alright.
Wait.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
What?
What is that?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
... Why?
I don't believe it.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
Dan! Arrest them!
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Mr. Simpson ...
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
You know him?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
What do you mean?
So what's the point?
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Mmmmgh.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
... Like Prince Charming.
McIntire's.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Look ...
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Bud ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
It's an art book.
TV repair.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Hey.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
What's the listing?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
You look nervous.
No.
No.
No.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Uh-huh.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
-- you said you did.
It was cool last night.
Hello?
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Hi.
Oh My God.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
You see?
What did he want?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
There's a better place for us to eat.
Are you learning how to play it?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Really?
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Where you married?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
Are you ok?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
What do you mean?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Sorry about that.
Yeah.
It's alright.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
What's up?
What happened?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
....now: this pudding?
Where you been?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Ok.
As soon as you want.
That's it.
Yeah.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Madeleine --
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Ow!
In part, yes.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
I saw the longing in your eye --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
And --?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
As you say, Doctor.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
How is the patient faring?
As for the author... shoot him.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll pass the word on, then.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
This is neither the time nor the place --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
How was I to know, my darling?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
There. That's right.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
It's not really--
Then you explain it to me?!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
I just want to understand--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
He lied to me
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
You drink at 10 am, do you?
I wanna see the picture today
What are movies about, Orson?
Manolete?!
This better be good
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
I don't have it anymore?!
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
I'm sorry.
Hedy Lamarr?
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
Mank!
You're lying to me.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
For the title
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
How 'bout a real drink?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
What's up, Colonel?
Believe what you want.
Where you going at this hour?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Answer me when I talk to you.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Stick out your hands, Jake.
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
What do you mean, "you"?
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Nine o'clock.
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
I like the gym smell.
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
You're not interested in him?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
I went out.
Jake --
Can't you get the money from your friends?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
She never left the apartment --
-- until yesterday morning.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
But I'm not a killer!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Jefferies.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Something wrong?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's abnormal.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
He and his wife splitting up?
Thank heaven that's over!
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
No.
Hello.
Yes.
How's your leg?
And your stomach?
Something big going on somewhere?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Big enough?
What a day I've had!
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
What is it you're looking for?
Lisa, please!
What are you getting at?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
We have all -- what?
The same.
I hate funny exit lines.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Steady Marlon!
Feel okay?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
You satisfied or you want more?
Where can we meet?
Sure.  It's fine.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
I like you, you know?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.  We're going to bring him down.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
You can't protect me.
You thought I was Mom?
Go ahead.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
I don't think so--
He depended on me.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Are you going down there?
See?  It stopped.
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
What's your name!
It's me!
Hey where'd you go?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
I don't want you for my father!
Plato?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
You sure?
No.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Who's that?
I shot at one of them.
How!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Do I have to spell it out?
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
They never do.
Okay--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
Where you going?
Oh, Jim!
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
You can't talk underwater!
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I guess I just don't understand anything.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
-- till he fucked his parole --
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
You can't find... what?
Toys for... adults?
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You need a COAT!
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
No, Nick, no --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
He working for them on this one?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They've never done a robbery?
So does it look a lot different?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
He wants to see your map.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
What?
But I never said Rudy.
So you could get with my sister.
Where's she work?
Hey, it's... been two years --
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
NO.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
...so where is he?
Cancer-sucker.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You want that for here or to go?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
What the hell was that about --
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
Monsters in the gelatin...
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Jesus, Rudy --
Do what?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I don't know, but somebody did.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Me and Mr. White?
But what is this?
I'm sorry.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
What's that?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I know.
Your name's Freddy something.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Follow you where?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
As opposed to good?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Nope.
So, is he dead or what?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
Not these guys.
You can't leave us here.
Our kind of women?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
There's a nice boy.
But the rest is right.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
All my clothes --
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
In a fight?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Why?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
You'll live.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
You're not bein' quite fair.
It isn't that --
You're sure there's more where this came from?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Goodbye and thanks.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Maybe I better start working on him.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
I said let's go.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Maybe I could start you out.
Good night, Miss Wells.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Then I know my alphabet.
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Goodnight.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Hey, Brenda.
My favorite memory was when we --
Thanks.
Ouch!!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Shhh... It's okay.
Where's Shorty?
Ray, run faster.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Feel that?
Cindy, let me...
Listen to me I --
Let her go, Cin.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Both of them?
Noooo!!!
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
I got it!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I finished all the interviews.
Here you go, Professor.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Would you please focus?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
I can do it myself.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
You're not wearing a belt.
I'm so glad you're here.
Yes.
Father, I think you should rest.
What does it say?
"Ray!"
Oh, boy! 
What a bitch!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Here we go again.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Chip, honey?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
He goes to college with me!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Hi, Hank.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Don't wake the kids...
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
State your name, please.
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Certainly not!
Murder, honey.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
About forty-five dollars.
Why, Mary --
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
 What have you done about Irving August?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
But I'm not joking.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
I have been at the library.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Perhaps.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Would they hurt her?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Yes.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Because I have something very important to do.
Oh, uh-huh.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Of course not.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
No.
About sex?
This is just... so...
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Tell me your name.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Did you have sex before you were married?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
So you do fantasize?
About me?
Have you fantasized about me?
Her name was Elizabeth.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Subtlety?
You're really never going to make love again?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Because.
I can't tell you like this.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Yes. I just got busy.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Why?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
God, no.
No, he left last week.
What do you mean, like physically?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I hate my sister.
I say it because it's descriptive.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, I didn't.
Because I never got around to it.
I don't want to talk about it.
Questions about sex.
It's a sun dress.
I was just trying to --
Do you have my work number?
Do I know you?
How did you find me?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Doing what?
And that's all?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
How do we start?
Do I sit or stand?
Your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Then what happened?
No.
I've got to get back to the office.
Who said I was jealous?
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Do you want me to stop calling?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Why not?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
No.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Hi, John.
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Jesus!
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Another kiss?
Anything wrong?
Well? Supper at my place?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
What happened?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
Yes?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
BREAKING OUT
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
I know, I know, it's just...
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
When do I get to see Brad?
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'll leave you young things to it.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
. . .For his own good.
F for...
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
THAT MINIMAL
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
So what's up?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Is it chicken?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Hi.
I can explain.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Yeah.
Oh, that's tasty.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
That's your problem, Miles.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
How would you rate this one?
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
We're on.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Oh, boy.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Been checking your messages?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You know what I'm thinking?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
We gotta go back.
Please, Miles, please.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
So what's the plan?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
You broke some.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
You got kids?
What's the title?
Oh. You mean... today?
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Okay. See you around.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
Where's Jack?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Houdini's sick.
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
There's dust in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Hi sweetie.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
I cursed.
It's noise.
How can you say that?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
They're broadcasting...
How many died?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
It needs batteries.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Dad.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Stop crying!
I can't even imagine.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
I didn't know you were out.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
McKendrick's men got him.
Kate?
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Offend anybody lately?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
I'll see you around.
Daddy?
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
What's all this then?
Rae, all we got is each other.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
What is it you want from me?
I'm going to have to look into this.
I thought we talked about that.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
You work here?
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What's this?
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
How about you?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
The public decides who's on that list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Even the fall from the plane?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Really?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
My two favorite girls.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
For her?
You can't.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
Not quite how I imagined it --
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Okay, Dad.
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer...
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Why, Malcolm?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
Where should I look then, Cole?
Know what?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
I didn't know you were funny.
How often do you see them?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
Are you wigging out?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
You were great in the play, Cole.
You know that accident up there?
Someone got hurt.
She wanted me to tell you--
I don't like people looking at me like that.
What--
Could take a little while, though.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Bitch.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Aha. The Lovers.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Come on --
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
You're out of your mind, man.
Are you crazy?
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Sure. What do you want to know.
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Shit!
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
What about Jeremiah?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
You wouldn't understand.
What are --
Where's Mac?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Grant, where'd you go?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Where are you?!
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Meat.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Flip.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
I'll get if for you.
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
You.
What's he get if he wins here?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Kate McConnell.
Is this fun?
Seriously?!?
Guess what?
Well?
Jesus!!!
See ya, Kate.
Mississippi's the other way!
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
I'm begging.
No.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Why are we doing this?
Liquid gold.
Bandit I, do you copy?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
We're outta motion lotion.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
I'm all ears.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
I think you're just yellow.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Five thou.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
He's giving them up?
Maroon uniforms?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
...I forgive you Darwin.
Really?
I've got concerns.
What happened?
D'you talk to'm?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
That's probably him now...
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
It's the last place they'd look.
Where's Israel?
My debrief --
...Does he know?
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
I wouldn't go that far.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
You got clicks, anything?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Why?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Gibarian.
No?  Who am I, then?
What happened to Gibarian?
I want to hear your version.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
She'll come back.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Is there anybody else here?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What happened?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
When did this happen?
Jesus...
I need to see Snow.
What are they?
Where've you been?
Why did you say those things?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
What does Snow think you should do?
Who have you been talking to?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
You're the coward.
But that's what happened before.
You said he was dead.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Claire!
It's terrific Win.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Yeah.  It was.
What's to like?
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Stop, will you?!
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
"For"...?
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
She took you shopping for a tie?
Did you hear what I said?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you watch?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Yes.
I asked for the man in charge...
You're here 'til what time?
Why should she come in?
How do you know where the gun is?
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Flash, drop it--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
What's in there?
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Are you okay?
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Yeah--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Good morning, Liz.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
Hello, Liz.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Yeah, Roz.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
I'll introduce you.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Peter, what can I do for you?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
There's only one pair left.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I'll live.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Let me go! Let me go!
You want Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Easy, Animal! Easy!
What do those broads say?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
May I have this dance, Miss?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Lay off, Sefton.
You heard that, Sefton?
You off your rocker?
You taking Dunbar?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Captain=8A
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Do you remember him?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
This is the Nexus?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Can I?
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
But I do have a theory...
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Report.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Doctor Soran?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Response?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Aye sir, coding now.
Why don't we beam it up?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
What happened...?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
See! That shimmering area.
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
No.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Yes, I was...
Then, how --
... He spoke of your friendship.
He asked you not to grieve...
... Or the one.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Sir, may I suggest --
I ordered no interruptions.
Firing range, sir.
500 Kellicams!
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
They even killed the galley chief.
Until now.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You're crazy -- !
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
Well done, Commander.
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
We encoded four minutes --
I didn't expect anything.
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Well?
We'll lose them if they go in there.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Genesis, what's that?
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Scotty -- what's left?
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
... No response, sir.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
Yes, Spock.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
I would not presume to debate you.
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
In my quarters, Uhura.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Reliant's command...
Indeterminate life signs.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
How?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Time from my mark...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Prepare for warp speed.
You lied.
How're you doing?
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Bones --
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Oh, joy.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Hi... Busy?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
You mean man...
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Here... In the park?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
The late 20th Century.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Ready sir.
I have no control, sir!
What is it?
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
You have warp capability?
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
A perfect moment?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Don't you ever get tired?
Really.
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Will he live?
Hello, Data...
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
How many?
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Implants bothering you?
I don't think they believe us.
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Deck five.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Come in.  Hi.
Augh.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
You actually performed surgery...?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Do you know what this is, Data?
Isn't it better like this...?
What did you do to the batteries?
This must be it.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
No... the door's too thick.
What's still there?
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Yes.
Where in the States?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
What do you want?
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Did you need something?
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Captain?
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Even Data?
Good luck, Captain.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
What the Hell's going on?
Figures.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Damned clever if you ask me...
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
They'll respect him now...
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Klingon blood.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
An accident wasn't good enough...
What took you so long?
And your coat.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
This is incredible -
Aye, sir.
I hope you're happy.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Surely not.
Captain...
The peace conference.
What's she waiting for?
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Any progress?
A lie?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Praxis?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Do you know who I am?
Why?
Remember him?
How long does he have?
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Yes, sir.
How long until we reach the fleet?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
How can you be sure?
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
You have a red shirt.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
I'm going to miss you.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
You're not here.

It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
We're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
It's working.
Sir?
But she's not the Enterprise.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
It's not quite the face you remember.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
Looking up at the stars.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
Hello, Jean Luc.
What are you doing?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
It’s too late.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Praetor...
And?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I don't like it, George...
Hello George.
No deal.
Mrs. Haydn...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please...
What?!
Smile... good?
Minneapolis... good.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Who are you?
Who?
Horses.
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes.
The captain...
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
It's bad.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
How long will it take you to get home?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
I love you.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
No, sir. Radar.
To the same woman?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
I made my choice, Lenny.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Maybe.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
What's going on?
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
You should feel like shit.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He's been cooked-off
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
How did you hook up with Faith?
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Charm.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
What's his name?
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What is it?
What is it?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Tell me.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
Mace... you're a girl.
Are we under arrest?
No.
Anybody talk to the press?
You run the plates?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
I have 6 tons.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Look, mister...
You're a... you're sick.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
We have another one.
Speck. Harold Speck.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
I'll take it into consideration.
I'm hesitant to...
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
I've been thinking about this.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Start killing people for real?
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Agent Mackelway?
How's the arm?
Suspect Zero?
So you went underground?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
No.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Yeah.
Well, thank you...?
Hi.
Anything?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Oh my God.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
On the table.
It's not going to well?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...well, it suits you...
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
So what's the difference?
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Well that sucks.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
Why?
I don't talk about her that much.
Kinda money, huh?
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
They turned you down?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Who threw this party, anyway?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
That's right.
Hello?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
We're going to Vegas.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Wait.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
That's not cool.
It doesn't matter...
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Double down.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
You think so?
She likes you.
I don't know...
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Oh... a Dorothy.
What was the part?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Sorry about interrupting...
She was hot.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What are you doing?
We got the digits, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Tomorrow?
So, two days?
Because he's a bitch.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...shivering...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
You look terrif on the floor!
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
But you needed a drink first.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
What miracles you do for strangers.
No, I wanted other things for you.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Give them some money and send them home.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
We should hear what they have to say.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
I've never seen anything like it.
They're talking to themselves.
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
What will your father say?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Hello.  Kay?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Send some bodyguards.
We're going to New Jersey?
What is it?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Marge, you like everybody.
I'm intruding.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
You like jazz!
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
And Rome.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Freddie?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Why?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
I guess.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
You should watch that!
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Mr Greenleaf.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Okay.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Dickie!
Hello Marge.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
How long's he staying for?
Oh my God. Tom.
Did he kill Freddie?
You've got Dickie's rings.
Marge? Where are you going?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
What?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Where's Dickie's father?
Is this you?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Let's go.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Will we see you later?
What rumour?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Dickie Greenleaf?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Why?
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Where do you live?
That would have been quite a coincidence.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
But this is a porno movie.
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
What about the record?
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
This I gotta see.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
That's fine.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Huh?
Hello.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Do they drug you?
God, you are square.
Who's a killer?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Why should it be grounded?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Some. Here and there.
So I hear.
Is that so?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Get it.
Travis.
What's the action around?
Stick with Carla.
No.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
What are you doing?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Dad?
I do?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
We were in love... weren't we?
What was that?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
My what?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Why?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Luke... what time is it?
Did I what?
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Here, one of mine.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Not at all.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Ancestors?
I suppose.  Thanks.
They all know you?
You hungry, son?
Miss Hayworth?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
And what had you done?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Do you think I should go?
Yes.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Yes, I did.
Mother!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They haven't harmed anyone.
Are you coming to my party?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Mitch, let's turn back.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
No, it's Lois!
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Where does he live?
See them two big trees across there?
The two kids?
Yes.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
And certainly pretty.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
Yes?
Mitch...
I can handle it.
They're gone. The same pattern.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
That's the last of it.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I understand completely, sir.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Some of them are.
How?
When?
I didn't break that window!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What's that?
Why... 
Right next to the one you already had.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
Do you want some mustard with this?
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What it was, probably...
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
Do you want to try your father again? 
When will they stop?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
Birds?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
But this woman -- and her son --
But you did promise.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
I thought this was a school day.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Toddy hates me.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
You and I should work together.
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Any attacks of pain since?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
We won't.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
You killed her. I saw it.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
What did they give you?
Fuck. Me.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
You killed that cop Dutton.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Erin. It's not your fault.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
An accident, Nathan.
But you, you've had them.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
What were you yelling about?
What? What is it?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It still doesn't mean...
Sweetheart...
Please. Come inside.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
What does that mean?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
We certainly did.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
You must have come a long way.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Well, we could--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
How do you know?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
No. That's all finished.
Is it worth anything?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Why not?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Should I run him through?
They're looking at us.
I can't beat a Triumph.
Don't!  Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where's Star, David?!
Where you going?
Look.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
He's not glowing.
Oh, no...
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Ouch, my hair...
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Good!
You didn't tell David?
Still mad at me?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Tell them to get something to eat.
He met a girl.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Not funny, Sam!
Ohmygod...
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Say hello to Thorn.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
Then it's not too late for us...
You've got to put this on.
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
You're beautiful.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Sixteen.
What was he doing in the rec room?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
How you doin', old boy?
Somebody broke in.
We got to burn 'em.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
Childs!  That a fuse?
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
What's happening?
MacReady!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Where's the other half?
Torch them!!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
I think so.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Anything?
Would that test have worked?
I guess you're okay.
After all this mess then.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
How long's it been?
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Get back!!
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
What's happened?!
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Sir... have you a name?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
When was his mother taken?
Send him away.
Yes...
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
That was a foolish thing to do.
And why not?
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
Admiration?  My my.
Dance with me...
Alex...?!
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I've been working.
Yes.
His curiosity is amazing.
Is he all right?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
It was different then.
Yes, sir, he --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
And roosters.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Sir?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
But... what about Starks?
Should we be...
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
And what's that?
Yes.
Who are you?
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
This is really happening, isn't it?
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
You're just gonna walk?
What for?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I gave you my dog tags.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
But no one knew until after...
Do you really believe me?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I have no idea.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
They're not here.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
What?
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
The future doesn't look different?
What about the world?
Why don't you help me?
Who...who kills me?
You know how to get there?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Becker does? Are you sure?
You ever been to jail?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
You want a drink?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
No!
Alright.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Oh shit.
Stop.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So how come you don't have any kids?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
You're a bank robber?
Tell me.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Louise.  Where are we going?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
You're disturbed.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Idaho?
Now what?
Whaddo we do?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Before.
What little dogs?
This is so beautiful.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I am really sorry about this.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
We can live in a hacienda.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
You know what's happened, don't you?
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You're a good friend.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
God!  It looks like the Army!
Are you going to apologize or not?
Oh, Jesus!
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Why not?
His mother?
What's so funny?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Check.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Dom? What are you?
Mary.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
I work with retards.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Lint?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Are you okay?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Jai alai?
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Friend. Baseball bat.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Have you been up all night again?
Meaning?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
What's he like?
I don't watch the new ones.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat does projects all over the world.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Sure.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Twenty-two.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
It.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Uh-huh.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
The other thing is...
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
What's it about?
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
When are you going to be home?
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Hello?
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What's this about?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Her oil pan is shot.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Alright. Alright...
Tread matches. It's the car.
Jesus, you alright?
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
What's he smoke in that?
What was he saying?
Red Deer Table, Ray.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
What's that?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
This Clear Moon's house?
You take care.
This Jimmy's?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Ray. X22.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
I'll bet!
That's a big comfort to me.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I beg your pardon.
Why not?
You saw a MiG 21?
It's what?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
The what?
What would?
There you go with those moves again.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
No!
Does it bother you?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
I want it understood.
Danger?
Lucky charm.
This is it, then.
That's not what I hear.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Off me or off you?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Well... What   is   it?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
That's missile lock!
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
I know!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
So I've heard.
You think you can stay up with us.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
It's a victory roll.
Something bothering you?
1000.
That's Kazanski.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
A plaque?
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
I guess I owe you one.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You didn't help.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
How do you feel?
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Need a ride?
Shut up and drive!
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
But I thought...
Kill him.
Bob?
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Suppose I do...then what?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Sit down.
You're Kuato, right?
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
No shit...
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Where?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Where is he?
Look at this shit.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Who is she?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
And you believe him?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
I love you.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
No options.
I'm not interested in that.
Forget I said wife.
Don't be ridiculous.
Now what?
What can I do?
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
You know, up the jeep trail.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You're really leaving, huh?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
So long, cactus!
You're full of shit.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
You want the rifle or the Smith?
You go north, I'll go south.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Watch your ass, shithead.
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
How's she doing?
We playing cards tonight?
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
I brought it... to the coroner.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
...Where're we goin'?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Ms. Vin's sister.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Oh really?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
We have a full caseload, Rog.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- a speed manufacturer --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why?
Afraid of what?
What went down?
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Edward T. Dowd.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
I followed you here from court.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Tell me some other things about her.
I'm nearly out.
Here he comes.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Phillip?
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
That would indicate that it's the future.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
What is it?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Laura?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Why do you do it, Laura?
Nice night.
The pages are gone. That's real.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
What's going on?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You'd think so.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Dad.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Who was that?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
No.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...he wants to testify...?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
What book is that?
I did.
Objection, we've...
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Do you know who her doctors were?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Thank you.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
One hour.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Listen to me, fella...
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
I'm a lawyer.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
Do you think it's my fault?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Joe...  Joe...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Gruber.
Another, Frank...?
...now who is that...?
...he's a good man...
Who have we got?
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
Been a long time, huh...?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
That's right.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...four years ago...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I just saw her.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You look kinda lost yourself.
You seem to know a lot about him.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They've all stopped at the same time.
How does it happen cars are running?
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They don't do much of anything...!
Must be somebody in there.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
No, you don't.
He's had some sort of...episode.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Diabetes?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
no.
You going away?
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
This is going to give you nightmares.
Time for sleep.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
He's on his way.
You okay, champ?
Heather?  You doing okay?
When do you think it'll be done?
What...happened?
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
I want to see the body.
I'm sorry, I can't.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Yes?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Did we lose anybody?
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
Fine.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Where you going?
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Why then.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Do you have your ticket?
How ya doing?
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
What is it we can do for you today?
Oh, really?
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
And being sixteen.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Tie it off!!
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
What's it going to be?
No.
They are much more than that, sir.
For killing a dolphin.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Y'all take American Express?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
No... I don't think so, man.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
The Good Witch...
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
What?
What is it, Johnnie?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You won't of missed much.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
That don't seem fair.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Huh?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Who do?
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
How much we got left, honey?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
How'd you know my daddy?
Lula, you there?
There's worse places, honey.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Course I am, mama.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I know... I remember.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
You're stoned.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
Tripp?!
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
James? My James? What's happened?
How bad is it for you?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Is he awake?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Hello?
...reconcile with Emily.
Goodbye, Grady.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
You cold, James?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Thank you.
Washed up?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Humboldt County?
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Carvel.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Kinship. And what's here?
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
What?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
I'm sorry.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Want a bite?
When?
I'm not going, with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Get out of here.
Yes, Hannah?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Hey.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I got the message you called.
You go first.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Not have it.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Oh?
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
I'm through improvising.
Ouch. How many?
Did you tell Walter?
That's a nice greenhouse.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Oh?
Excuse me?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where you stand?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
You doing okay?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Cherry.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
Fucking Mariners.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
How does it sound?
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
You don't know?
It's not for sale.
You don't know?
I wasn't feeling well.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
So. How are you adjusting?
Just trying to be helpful.
No.
Robin?
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
And how's your job?
It's very good, indeed.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Why do you think you're here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
What is your idea of being a Jew?
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where?
Don't ever do that again.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
You felt pleasure.
How do you feel about that?
Want a ride?
Southern light.
Doesn't it get noisy?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
They could eat you.
So?
Did I say something wrong?
Hey, there.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
And what do you tell yourself now?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I love my brothers.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
I've got problems.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
She-hit.
How you guys doing?
Where are we?
I can't believe you let them do this!
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
But what did he see that made him panic?
What about O-2?
Jesus, Lindsey--
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
You owe me one, Virgil.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Virgil?
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
A little more so this time.
But how could you say such a thing?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Somebody must live here!
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Nothing... nothing at all!
Are you feeling better?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Claudia, listen to me...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Does it please you to say such things?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
That's why I asked you...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
And who is this?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Anything new develop?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
No.
I can't say.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
But she watches... she listens.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
For what?
No I'm not.
I don't know.
From their heads...
From God.
Don't you know?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to be?
Why not?
How did she know that?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
What the child?
She tells you you're ugly?
Why?
I'm frightened.
Did you want it to come out?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Why isn't anyone coming?
She said Michael.
Are you frightened?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
For what he made me go through.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
You saw it all didn't you?
What did you do?
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Larry...
Something they... that they overlooked.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
No.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You were a smoker?
I can beat that.
How did she hide it during the day?
Could there have been anyone else?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
Not simple, no.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Oh, Dear God...
When was that?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit yourself!
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Fine thanks...
Do you want to become one?
She's been touched by God, yes.
Why must he be anybody?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But how did it happen?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what I have to believe...
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
This is permission to take her apart.
Did you know she was pregnant?
You wanted that child out of the way.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Sure.
Ever seen one of these before?
I see you go to the night court.
We're nearly there, sir.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Gerron.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Oh, there you are!
I don't think that bit's right.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Oh!
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
But that's not like a real person at all.
What are you?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And what do you do about it?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
You're only right.
What are you doing?
What are they saying?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Come on let's get this coffee.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Yeah ... so what?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Is that yours?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Gie's a kiss!
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Behave...
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
You are.
And my nose...
Aye, but you know him well.
You're a window rattler, son.
He's betrayed the class.
Temper! Temper!
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well ...
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Paul's grandfather.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
What?
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Don't you remember?
What's wrong?
Computer, what language was that?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
You like this shit?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened to the lights?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's clear.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
Where did it come from?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
Hey now, what is this?
Yes?
He's running a fever.
Yes.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
What's happening up here?
That must have been when he got it.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
There, it caught!
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Okay.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
But?
Find anything we missed?
Still worried?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Would somebody fill me in?
What film?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Where did the parasites come from?
Take us up.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Now what?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Which presumably means...
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
Let's hear it.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Better?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Seal everything now!
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
What's going on?
Not yet.
Something spooking the rhinos?
One of 'em must have escaped.
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
Wait.  Lost it.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Is this the suit?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Do you believe him?
So, what do you think?
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
And what is your name?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Addison...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't think I'm going.
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Let's go sit by the piano.
We never met. That's why.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Then you're crazy.
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Okay.
When I'm guest of honor?
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So she seems.
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
It's all over.
The kid. Junior.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I will not calm down!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Don't be condescending.
It's not nonsense.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
Hello, what's your name?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Every day.
Yes. Yes, it does.
What have I got to do with it?
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
The same size?
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
She's loyal and efficient-
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
Late for what?
What are you doing here?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
May I have your coat?
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
No, don't go...
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
What - again?
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
The curtains. I made them myself.
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Ain't it the truth?
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
Lloyd, what happened...?
What time is it?
Eve.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
I'm glad Bill's back.
Would you, really? How sweet-
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Who's left out there?
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I said I'm a dying man!
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
What's that?
Goddamnit--
See her?  Get anything?
And?--And?--
Who's first?
Who'd you vote for?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
I think that's him.
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeesus--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Tell that to Muskie.
Can't help you.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
--I'm sure--
We can't talk inside either?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
Are you sure?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
...go on, go on...
Who's Colson, Harry?
So?
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
What else have you got?
Mr. Sloan?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
All right, I got some scotch.
Of course, Finch.  What?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Come on!  I won't tell.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
What about the game?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Dad.
Dad!!
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
...excuse me?!
This'll do.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
You can do that?
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Ho-lee shit.
Tonight?
Yeah.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
What reputation?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
What about your glasses?
Don't you want to change?
This looks familiar...
Serafine...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
What the fuck!? You too!?
What does it say?
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Claude...?
Another step and he's dead!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
You recognize her?
We know you were with her.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Not you too -
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Uncle Terrence?
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Jesus...
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Here.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Saint Severin...
Why were you so late tonight
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I'm going to stretch my legs
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Dmitri?
Who are you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
It's her.
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
What do you want?!
I'll show you!
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
You are the boy ...
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
What's your name?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Can I have your autograph?
You're like New York. You're an island.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Lyndon Johnson?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Oh - you're an actress.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Right!  Where?
For yuh.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Neat?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
We can digest our-
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Look at these guys.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
No, I'm not.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
You- Do you love me?
That's the key question.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Uh-uh-why?
Really?
Oh, you have my body.
Were you always funny?
You're so sure about it.
You followed me!
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
I'm home!
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Yeah, this place is great.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You look very pretty.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Alvy.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Who said that?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Yes.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Stop calling me Max.
Ah.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Well, sit down.
You wanna lie down?
The one with the V.P.L.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
But she's colored.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh. What about?
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Was it a contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
It has your ring.
It's going.  It's going.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Never.
So where is young Jonah?
Thanks for coming.
He's gonna miss his flight.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
And?
But she's alright.
Oh.  You're them.
There's a test, you know.
Go.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
You only made half your quote this year.
We'll be fine.
Two minutes.
It's an unfair advantage.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce.
Dolphins.  Great.
Don't be so sure.
She left the fucking gate open.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It's not like this all the time.
About me!
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Cal, too?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I know.
Not long.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Easy tiger.
I need to leave you now.
Lemon or raspberry?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
How do you do, Skye?
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I think there are sixteen there.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Ready to go?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Ryan!
I...
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Is there space here?
I was impressed.
That was my clue.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Are you lovesick?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Shit!
So how are you really doing, Panes?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Why not?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Thank you, Panes.
What did I do?
Nevermind.
So where should I put it?
It's much more personal in here.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
You're right!
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
You dance...
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
So what makes you so special?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Bala!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
ARREST HIM!
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
...I should?
What do you see out there?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Yeah, I know.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Say, you got a lulu.
Twenty-seven.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Three.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Here.
Your phone.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Who?
His apartment?
What's her first name?
When are you coming home?
Something wrong with your legs?
Your stomach?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
I don't want it.
Too slow?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I would.
Thank you.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
I mean, after that?
We're going to finish that gin game.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Last night?
The Vice Squad?
Where are you going, Baxter?
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I am?
You know how people talk.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You left your wife?
You like?  It's all yours.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Yes, sir.
Very clever.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
How do you spell her last name?
I'm not sure.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Who is Mickey?
Family?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
That guy really must've belted him.
Please -- just let me sleep.
What for?
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Yes, I know.
Well -- thank you.
I missed you, Fran.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
You're not being funny.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Now, Fran --
Coming?
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Are you there, Fran?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Where do you live?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
So what happened ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Arch light.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
That's a light down there --
Who's he?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Can I go get those mangos now?
Flood.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Well, get in there.
I --
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
Will they attack?
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
No, sir.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
The wind --
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
What's the furthest you been in?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's yours?
How did we get here?
I had immense plans.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
What's that?
He'll kill us.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
You hear it again?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
You think?
What?
Who are you?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
134  CONTINUED:
Let's go.
113  CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
Where'd you say Eric is?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
He's coming around fine.
I'll go into town with you.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
What's going on?
Leave it here.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Don't push me..!
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
I need to rent a cabin.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
Go easy.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
...Ben never sent a signal.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
I'm sorry.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Sorry.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
What needs clearing up?
What's this?
I can't. I work.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Hey -- you let him...
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
You wanna dance?
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Hello.
Okay to say something now?
I wasn't asleep!!
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Good night.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
Help!
You changed the room around...
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
How's Verdell doing?
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
She's nice.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Shall I get her for you?
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Oh, is he dead?
Which color was that?
Yeeeess!!!
No, I didn't.
Please, just leave.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Not it at all, really.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Because...  ... you love her?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
What are you doing?
You can't --
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
What does that fucking mean?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Michael?
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Where have you been, Robert?
How did he know?
Hello, Robert.
Is this how it went, Nick?
A player?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Now what?
An assassin?
Who is that other guy?
So this is something between you and him?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Electra.
Yeah.
It looks like white's game.
More or less.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Good.
Hey, where are you?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
Breakfast.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Then, we wait.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
What did he want?
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
Because, I'll take it.
Can I ask you something?
Was she the only one?
Were you attracted to me right away?
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
I thought it was interesting --
Do you ever regret things you've done?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Cheers Katka!
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I've been saying that since we met.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Nope.
We're going to need it all.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, We aren't going to do it.
And a tram hit you?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Now you're using that word.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
And if you're wrong.
What do you want me to do?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah, pretty well.
Take this exit.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Sure, they are students.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
About forty minutes.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
What's the Bugler?
A champion of lost causes huh?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
And the students?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
That's my bag.
Why are there still such headlines?
What are you an idiot!
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Out with Belinda?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I told him to leave me alone.
Now it's okay?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I'm thinking.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Who are you?
Get yourself a glass.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
Because, growing up, books were my world.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
This play -- ?
That's deep --
What the -- ?!
I'll take a chance.
No problem --
You think so.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
You're not in a very good mood.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
I don't want to be just your friend --
So you're talking to me?
Hey.
Is there a rush?
Your turn.
You're acting like a crazy person.
I don't understand...
Come on.
Jamie --
Help me live until I die?
How you doing?
But if you could, you would?
What's Landon Carter up to?
Did you give him a gift?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
You're in the play?
I care for her.
You have materials for the side bearings?
I thought she built it herself.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
For Jefferson High. For books.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
How was school today?
Learn anything?
What time does school start around here?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Fine..
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why what?
You mean, you're gonna --
You have a name?
Operator...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
But Professor --
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Professor? Professor Brown?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
How did you know?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
You answered the door!
I know.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
What year is this?
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
What theater was I at?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Hi. where's Cato?
Oh yeah?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
How you doing, Cato?
That's what he told you, huh?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You like people?
Then why'd you do it?
Well, Kit...
Sure is pretty.
Okay.
Jack.
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Can I be honest?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Is that all there is to it?
I came in the front.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
What'd you put him in there for?
No.
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Fine.
Hi.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Anybody we know?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Oh, my.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Never.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Stay here, I'll be back.
Pictures don't lie.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I see.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
If you could, I'd –
Before what?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
I beg your pardon?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm a writer. Ted O –
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
What do you do far a living?
What do you mean, Barton?
...That's fine.
...Barton, is everything okay?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
...Got a sweetheart?
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...This must be boring you.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Yeah, but –
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
You're leaving?
Hold on –
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
...I just don't know what... to do–
It's more than I've got.
...Yes, thank you.
I – Mr. Lipnik –
...Okay
What did... What did he –
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Big fuckin' deal.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Yes, Colonel.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
Catherine Tramell.
I need a cigarette.
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What do you want, Nick?
What are you doing here?
Did you go home with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Even though you were fucking him.
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
Am I... disturbing you?
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Aren't you going to thank me?
When did you write it?
Yes.
You shouldn't play this game.
You won't believe me.
Do you believe me?
Can I talk to you a minute?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
How did he die?
You have the right to an attorney.
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
He had a girlfriend?
Thanks.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
I don't know.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
Homicide.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
You sure?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
You knew her, didn't you?
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Is this finished yet?
When's your show?
What do you think?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Cool.
What's with the wigs?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
How much for these five?
When?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
What are they?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
I'm not black.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Would you like to see the wine list?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
It's Andy again.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Who am I?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
Drugs??!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Don't you think he's using you?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
That is amazing. What year is it?
Is that the best quality you have?
I'll take the whole tin.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
What? What do you want?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Hey, Rene.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
We've met.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
And a very, very good one.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
You have?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
I was just hanging around.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Winded, old timer?
You're not even listening to me.
That's gotta hurt.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
...Afraid.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
All the answers are numbers.
Letters in the alphabet.
How about, MR. E.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Why's that?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
You are direct, aren't you?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
La'chiem.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
What do you know about obsession?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
That kid is amazing.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
...Not the bat?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
I'll show you it works.
Holy shit.
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Go ahead. You can say it.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
How high up would you say that is?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Yes?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
How'd you find this place?
Is this what you wanted?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Great.  Give me a grant.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you want a drink?
Odd desire for anyone.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I don't sing very well.
All street mimes should be executed.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Keep her on the line!
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
My brother's a priest, man.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
And you want a --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
And what did you say?
Sort of half.....
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Goodnight Annie.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
David, David, David ...
Of course.
Welsh again.
Bye, Dad.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
... in the distant future.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Ow! These chips suck.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Uh, you first.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
They look like a couple of kids chief.
You see what I see, Bork?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Who sent ya?
You'll be rich!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Oh no.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
You'd better sit down, hon.
What?
Cabin fever, hon?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Oh, honey, we may need that.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
My God, we're back where we started.
I feel really stupid.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
What happened?
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Aren't you scared?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
What is going on?
Aren't you dead?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is <u>my</u> town.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
Handbook?  When...?
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
God, you're anatomically correct!
W... What is it?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Answer your mother.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
What's wrong?
Okay?
You don't have a key?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
They don't want to come down.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
You were wrong, it did hurt.
... Were you going somewhere?
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... He walked off...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Do you know Raphael?
Would you care to take it, sir?
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
I hope you're comfortable.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Would you care for a drink?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
What is that?
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Have you served in the Army?
I have no claim, Thomas.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No headaches?
You heard?
Do you feel well enough for that?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
I can certainly understand that...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
It's that gardener!
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
... So what does all that add up to?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
Is the trial date set?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
How was it?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Suck my dick!
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
People make mistakes.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Yex?
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Dr. Lester...
Emily Dickinson.
What'll you have?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
You wanted to be partners with me?
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No. Don't be an ass.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Impressions? Those are hard.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Yes?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
We have to meet.
How do we do that?
Never heard of it.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Yeah?
Who's calling?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Come on in.
You still there, sweets?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
You've got to be kidding.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You still know.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
She gone like they say?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Yes?
What you want?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
MAMA!
No...no...no..
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
He knew Baby Suggs?
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
The Gundersons.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
What's this?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Kill that poor woman.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Are you gonna split hairs?
Am I wrong?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please!  Please!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
No.  Here.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Howdy do, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
You mean coitus?
Yeah, but what about--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Finder's fee?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
No, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Hey man--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
What the fuck?
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
"Our" car, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Yeah.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Huh?
What's mine is mine.
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Employed?
Ah fuck it.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
'Scuse me?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Who the hell is he?
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
You're hurt.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Blade.
You don't want to go there.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
What do you want me to do?
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
Where were you, Whistler?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
And why is that?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
His name is Jared Nomak.
We're locked in.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Pretty.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Is something wrong, my friend?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
-- he's a vampire.
How did you know?
But, he could've --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Like what?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You're hurt --
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Just get out of here.
You care about him, don't you?
How's it going, Kam?
You don't have to be.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
How do you like that? Right on time.
But you use blood banks --
Blade --
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
Try, please, Anna--
What happened to her, where did she go?
No.
Domini?
What're you doing there?
What's she look like?
Yeah, so?
--<u>myth</u>--
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Was that you laughing?
Then I'm going--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
You want a hand?
How'd you know they were--
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Yeah. Me too.
Be it still alive, James?
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
Okay, but--
<u>What</u>?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
What--
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Jesus.
What?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Okay. Hypothetically.
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--yes--
Your mother's pastor.
Thanks, Meurice.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...Ray?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well I'll be damned.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Ray?... What time is it?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...Where is everything?
...So?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...What was that back there?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Now that don't make much sense.
...Anything else?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...There's a big--
Yeah. Is it...
Yeah...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...What did you do with the bodies?
What's this?
Howdy stranger.
...Why?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank. Come in.
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Why do you do it?
Okay?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Don?
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes. Frank-
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
How is Central these days?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Did you see her undressed?
Okay. be careful.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
You worry about me really?
It's good to see you.
NO.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Probably not. no. Why?
Hi Dad.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Yeah?
What?
I'm going out for awhile.
God. you scared me.
No.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
The coca is my responsibility!
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
Oh my G-d.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
I know.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
There's no room.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
Cocaine?  How much?
Mexico.
Barbara.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Money.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Source?  What about Derek?
Jesus Christ.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Alright.
Where are you going?
No, that's alright.
Not in front of the kid.
What?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
What?
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Right on.
Yeah?
So?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
No shit, Kevin?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Of course. As soon as possible.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Why?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
What is she saying?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Take some time off.
What about the will?
About three hours.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
What can we prove?
What induced it?
Then how did it get into his body?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Why would she want that?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Can I go?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Why did you come by?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Who found him?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
What happened next?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What happened after that?
What did she say?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
What did you prescribe for her?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Are you going to represent me?
Something like that.
How?
How'd you meet Marsh?
Can we get out of here?
Why not?
Yes -- she did.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
You lied to me!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Alone?
What's that for?
You don't need anybody.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
No -- he's lying.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
The witness will answer the question.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Humped
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's more involved than that.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
I don't mind waiting.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Eeeww!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
What?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Carolyn!
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Oh.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, really?
Mind if I smoke?
Where are you staying while you're here?
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
You sound like an artist.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Smells like dirt.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
Are you all right?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I would love to come for dinner.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yeah?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Why do you say that?
I can't do this, honey.
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Stop it!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I'm positive.
Betty.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Hey, kid.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Is this Hell?
I said, no thanks.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
And what's that?
I lied.
Please.  It's for your own good.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
How do you know?
What else does she say?
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Did you do it?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
What the hell do you want?
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You shouldn't have hit me.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
You can't leave.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
What did she do to you?
You murdered Gino!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
You know he would have done you, too.
What?  How about a drink?
Where is it?
You can't kill me yet.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Hello?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Are they really?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Okay, one drink.
I had to see you.
I wanted to apologize.
He's a launderer?
What's wrong?
I don't understand - ?
We're not that different, Corky.
Because it's the truth.
I don't.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
What?
It's in a case, on his desk.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
It's me.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Johnnie, what did I say?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
I won't ask again.
Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Who do you think sent me?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
His brother.  You know his brother?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I've got a situation here and --
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
Oh, Jesus...
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Get in the basement.
xxxxxx...
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What?
What the fuck is he doing?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
You drink rum?
...ergency procedures.
I think we'd better have a look.
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Sign here, please.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
You are late.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Christ! You do know it all!
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... no.
Tell me about Layton.
And you're mine.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack, she's innocent!
You stupid bastard!
How could you do this to me?
Stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Are you alright?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Yes, of course. Sorry.
OK. What's in the parcel?
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
What?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Hey - that's my desk!
You remember Samuel, my son.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Uh ...
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Sign here please.
For God's sake, what's happened?
Ha!!
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Es impossible.
You know each other a long time?
In that time, you ever have sex?
Where is she?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Okay, what happened?
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Sure, sure, give go.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
He's very very sick.
Is there any chance?
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Yes?
He's better, isn't he?
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Not as good as Nino's.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Three legs.
Don't give me that look.
I hate vodka.
Where you going?
Where's Burke?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Do it!
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
Faster! God!
You're in the stomach!
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
He excels at gratitude.
Eventually rising to...
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Nine seconds.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
What happened?
Well, whatever you think.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Yes.
How'd it go?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Don't go.
Let's go...
Yes.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Okay.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
The cost-efficient reporter.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
It's Aaron.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
I really have to go.
Yes.  How do you know?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I wish it were you giving the story.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Is everything all right?
You don't have to finish tonight.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
I had no idea she was this good.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
I'll wait for you till seven.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
It's not important.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Where's the bathroom?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Tonight.
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
Great!  What is it?
What's it called?
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Hi Walter.
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
I like you very much, Walter.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
Maybe so...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Are you alright?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
You...made that?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Hiya Carla.
You know what that proves?
You didn't mean to what?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
What do you have in the box?
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Hello Mayolia.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, OK.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I don't think this is gold.
Don't grab me, okay?
Booo!
No, we didn't.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I'm hungry.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Hi, Buffy.
What's Bobby gonna say?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Where are you gonna go?
You sure?
Thanks.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
I'm going to the dance.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
That's me.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
You look way pretty, Kim.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Just stay away from me, okay?
I was a slave.
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
What?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Sporting events, yeah.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Oh.  Sorry.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
Five?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
I want to die.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
I don't get it.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
I can't!
Why?  Why me?
Okay, let's go.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
What happened?
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
Oh, thank you very much.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Yeah maybe you're right.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
How was that?
Death is like spring training?
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
How 'bout a back rub?
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I'd like you to meet my father.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
She's dancing with me.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Don't tell anybody.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Crash...I want you.
Why not?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
You a God damn witch?
I got him on the knee!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Sorry about last night.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
Crash Davis?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Don't try me.
No.
He walked eighteen?!
Struck out eighteen...
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
He even played golf with the President.
You got it.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Okay.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Mommy.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
Ohh!
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
All right.
All right.
Listen, I would -
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
How'd you know I was here?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Okay. You come by the house?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
...and she doesn't always -
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
To Abraham Lincoln.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'll be right back.
Any change?
...pit bosses, floor managers.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Right?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Oh, it's so soft.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Hi. Nice to see you.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...under?
With the money.
The arrangement is over!
Oscar wants you to call him.
I had a... salad.
I was with somebody.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I want you to let me go.
Get - Get up! Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Just wait there for me!
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
...and hypocrisy.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Well...
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
...worst possible time for me.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
No.
Well, I... I never tried.
I just wanna get out of here.
...I got muscled on the street.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
What expenses?
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yes.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
He won't let me in my own house!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Can I go in?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Hey!
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Carmine left?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
You got a round figure on it?
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Uh-huh. Good.
Hi, Jennifer.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Okay.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Thanks.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Let me think about that.
You know?
Hm.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yes, you did.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Great.
All right.
I'm here.
I'm always here for you.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
We'll go later.
I just talked to him.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
They checked in alone.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Come here, come here.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
They're havin' a good time too.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Don't know.
Take it easy!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Charlie M?
Tony.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Again!
That's enough.
I know it, I know it.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
Are you sure?
Hmm. Not bad.
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I better go report this in...
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
We're waiting.
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
What's the catch?
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
What a "drag."
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
I'm a good mother!
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Good morning.
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Maybe.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
What if they do question the authenticity?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Any minute.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Lady, try making some sense.
Who smashed the phone?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Stop throwing names at me.
"Theo?"
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Hey drop it, okay?
What do you do for a living?
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Not a chance.
You can't give up.
Did you jiggle the phone?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Yes.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Whose money is this?
You timed that beautifully.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
I'm still okay.
What's Nels' number?
Any idea where you're going?
Think you could do a picture of me?
I'm handling it.
Know what else is in here?
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Pass.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Sure.
308-9962.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
And not a nickel.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
I can see the benefit in that.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
So let's call this the usual.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's still looking, Col.
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Don't be like that --
See, they get the wrong idea.
Sure, Dave --
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What's that supposed to mean?
Someone recommend you?
You American?
Jimmy.
He's getting up.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Piss off, Dave!
Would you like a drink?
No --
What would he think?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
You mean that?
Tell him it hurt --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Sure I do.
Don't.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Should have stayed a girl.
She from Scotland too?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Come on...
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
What?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Yes.
You killed my Jody
You didn't.
More endearments.
Say it again.
Dil!!!
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Did you give him it?
You don't know that.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
She's nobody. She likes me.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Perfect.
Jude?
Dil!
So?
You sure?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Why do you want to do that for?
So it was you all the time.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And who is she?
Who is he?
Thank God for that.
Fuck you.
I seen your fucking face.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
C'mere.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
You make a nice couple.
What the fuck am I doing here.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Fergus?
Why?
See? I was right about you.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Oh, yeah.
The best.
Do you?
Is it bad?
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
It was fun while it lasted.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
No -- I guess not.
What?
Oh, you should see your face.
What's the matter?
Adam!
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Of course there is!
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Reggie -- stop!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Then say it.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Why not?
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Carson?
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Yes -- ?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
It's Charles!
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Around one.
You'd lie about anything.
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Very pretty. Now what?
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Does it hurt?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Sure.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Why can't you be serious?
Said what?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Or Tex?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Hm?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Please keep it.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was a wealthy man?
Where did he keep his money?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Is it all right?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Up there! It is up there!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
But he is gone.
How's that?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Instant divorce you mean?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
En garde.
I don't think I follow you.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
We're here.
Peter -- are you all right?
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Stop that!
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Who is it from?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Yeah? What's that?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I get all your CDs.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
It's almost ten o'clock.
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi honey.
Hi honey.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
You found her?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
Well?
What are you doing?
She's not here.
Pay no attention to me.
You gave me a 'D'.
I am.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
What do you know about my father?
Yes.
Mark Shale.
Oh nice save.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
You can't tell your parents.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
Are you O.K.?
Why?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
What are you doing?
What?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
I said no.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where's Sam?
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
I got, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
All right, then how about this?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
Come on, get in the truck.
Damn.

We're clear.
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck! That's...
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
 

Take your gun!
What?
Oh, shit.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...I'm not the psycho.
You wanna hit me?
...Shift.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
What the fuck was that?!
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!
Ho, ho...
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
No.  Shit.
 Okay.  Okay. 
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
...you're dealin' with!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
...here!
How wonderful for you.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
A-And you  owe me...

They're takin' off.
We're gonna die!
Put your hand in my pants.


 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-natic.
...to him. 
Stop.
Oh, fuck!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

All right 


Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
You did help a little.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Oh!
I feel faint.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Vaughn.
Yeah, that's my truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
What?  Say again...
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
No, go--
...-ple.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...always done, Richard?
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?


Hit him again.

It's clean.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
What about these two?
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Yeah?
I want you to look at one another...
...the river.
...and unharmed, de-...

No.



Yeah?
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Rangers.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Hit it...
Forty-nine?
Great.  All right...
It's not over, Brynner.
That little geek is my...
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
And where are you going?
My secret?
...like a fish.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...without caution...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Mason.  Mason!
...public drunkenness....
...to talk, son.
Let me see your...
Get in 


I'll stay here and secure this position.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
An honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Always?
Very.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Just find the girl.
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I'll throw that in too.
Then what'll you do?
How do they do that?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I want the rest of the pictures.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I know what he says.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
That's it?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Mr. Gittes.
My husband's at the office.
I should talk this over with your husband.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Is there anything else you want to know?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Oh, yeah?
Never forgave him for what?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Maid's night off?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
When was the last time?
It was in Chinatown.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
This morning.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
It's possible.
Okay, give me the keys.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Yes.
I can't...
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
I'll take care of it.
...where does Kyo live?
Let me handle that.
Sophie.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Who?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
I don't understand.
You're a married man, am I right?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
The L.A. River?
Gittes?... Gittes?
No, really?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Gittes.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yeah?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Course, she settled down nicely.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You weren't expecting me?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
How long's it been shut?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Wasted?
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's the matter?
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
No, Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I know it is, Brad -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
Where's the towel?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
Close the door, Raymond.
Raymond - 
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I mean I've got a job for you.
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Why not?
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
All right.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yeah, all in crates.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
Jesus!
Fifty-five.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
So where is he?
Can I use the bathroom?
He was?
Nobody! I swear!
Train. It took eight hours.
I'm not pregnant.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I just told you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
This is the last time I come to this place.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
Cute cat. What's his name.
You only brought one ball?!
You're late.
What time do you have to stay till?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
You win.
Eight and a half.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm talking to myself here.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
The Emperor.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
What's he looking for?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Why'd you apologize?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Design major.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Jesus.
You hate people.
An embolism in a pool.
Stop it.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
May I be blunt with you?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Holy shit. That girl?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You're happy to get a fine?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
Who eats cock?
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Lovely story.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Why do you say that?
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Do you work tomorrow?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
What's that mean?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
You're kidding.
What? What is that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
I was kidding.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
And I actually date you?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
He requested this?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
I feel sick.
What is it?
Thank you for being rational.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I think the lady called it.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I beg your pardon!
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
We'll never know, will we?
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
I'm going with you.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
There you go.
Two...
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Did I miss something?
And I can't leave.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Gabe!?
It was great.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Can you see light?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Never, what?!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Thanks for holding on.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Have her come up.
What the hell are you doing--
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
He's alive!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Rich...
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
So this is the young man?
Fine, sir, fine.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Good.
Thank you, sir.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Are you an Epileptic?
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
How are you feeling today?
I'm your Psychiatrist.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
How many did I get right?
And when do I get out of here then?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Don't read it - sign it!
Yeah... Pete the English.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
How many to a cell?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Sixth is faster.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
The ride is free.
You like Bach?
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
The crowd had to dig it.
What kind of question?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
I was with Max when he got the call.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
You're kidding me.
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?  So?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
You on some kind of work plan?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
You listening to me?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
What about that?
How about the thingy next to it?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Get rid of 'em.
I can't believe this.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Max?  What are you doing?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down!
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
I was only going one way.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
What was your horse's name?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
He says a dog bit his nose.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
That's it?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
You want something to drink?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Was that who I thought it was?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Connecticut.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Then tell me what happened.
Love at first sight?
Back where?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I'm sorry.
Without a song in my heart.
Do I know you?
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You made your decision yet?
Can I ask you something?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
A dog.
I'm still listening.
So, you doing anything tonight?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Agent Lowry.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
He died...  ... in 1972.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
What in the hell...?
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Ellie...
You know why I'm here.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
David --
You...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
J39 Z186...?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
You're not real.  None of this is.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Can you show me?
So who...?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
It's time to go home now.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
And in return?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
Why don't you come back with me?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
We could be together again --
Ellie.
What day?
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Champagne please.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
How do you mean?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I read your book.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
So.  The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What are you so afraid of?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
How'd you find me?
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Tell us about it.
Please! Please!
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Go git it, Luke.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
You can't do that!
Lemme see it!
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Somebody say somethin'?
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Where'd the road go?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
But, Luke...
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I hate this...
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
When he was seventeen.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
Is it an ongoing case?
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
What happened to you?!
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Who's the married man?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
I don't want this.  What are they?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
It's a woman shot in a car?
They all have one...
You know how to use this?
Okay.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
What's wrong with him?
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Oh, maaaaan?!
Where you going?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Are we allowed to park here?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
Do we have to talk about this?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
How?
Maybe.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Yeah, everything's under control.
How can I help?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
You're slowing.
What do you think?
What's his name, Letty?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Tell us every detail.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Guess.
We'll get caught.
What else would you do?
I have a terrible confession.
Just checking.
It's TV heaven.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Michael.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Aunt Lily?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Silly, silly, silly.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Can I put these here for tonight?
Yeah?
But what about that math project?
I don't think so.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
So will you?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Where are the tapes?
A pass.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
They left about a half hour ago.
Where's your brother?
-- Super what?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
Someone else coming?
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
But you were there?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And the other half?
Yeah.   We just go home.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Do they come with batteries?
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
Don't bullshit me.
A thousand dollars?
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
They were all French guys.
Everything.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
They don't serve wine here.
This kind.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
I'll drive.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
Going somewhere?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
What happened?
Mr. Zammito?
Yeah.
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I think we went the wrong way.
You're not helping.
Algeria.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
And how do we do that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
You like shoes?
Did she break your heart?
Can't sleep?
Who are you waiting for?
Frankie, I --
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
I don't care about your sword.
Why do you want to teach me?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Tell me, who is your master?
You're home late... or should I say early?
You're already a thief.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I'm tired now.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
You're not married, are you?
You're doing calligraphy?
I'll give them to you.
Where is he now?
Let's end this here.
You shouldn't have come.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Save your strength.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
They're gone.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
You're welcome.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
How the hell did you do that?
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I've got him if you want him.
Who got himself what?
Are you okay?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
What do you mean?
You a lesbo?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
The Fountainhead.
At this hour? I don't think so.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
That's also none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
No, not at all.
Okay?
Sure. Have a good night.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Because I'm in love with you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What are you scared of?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
What are you doing?
I look terrible.
Want to join me?
I like it better when I'm on top.
You think?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
My daughter, Rachel.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Whoa!
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Positive.
Yes.
Yes!
She bought it.
One.
Pleased to meet you.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Yeah?
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Fuck her yet?
Loser.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Oh come on. For her first time?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Well done.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
She's out.
Right after we played backgammon.
I said, do you want some water?
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
What song, dear?
Did your wishes ever come true?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
What is it, Alice?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
I thought you were with Amy.
That's the Farren house.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
What'd you get for Christmas?
That's right!
It stands so still.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
But I only came to give back the ring.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
The Headless Horseman --
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hurry!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
How have you been feeling?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
George bit you?
Maybe they have to pee.
So did you do it?
At least your PMS is over.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
What did he say?
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I've been here. What day is it?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You expecting someone?
I think I just got my period.
You're such a good friend.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I know.
You're kidding, really?
You don't have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Where'd you get the bike?
It's a matter of life and death.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Coffee and...
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
When's the last time you saw him?
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Oh, it's nothing.
Yeah. Maybe.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
Was there anything in that washer?
Everything okay?
Uh.... hi!
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
No, why?
What happened?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
No, it was our first date.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You can't believe this bullshit.
How the hell is that your business?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
You think mafia hit?
I need something to keep me awake.
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
Please, they'll kill me...
Why do you want to speak to him?
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
How can I submit this?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Where do you think this goes?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Water?
Bad dreams?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Don't say a .
For a month.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
... what?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Clean.
Check his kids.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
No!...  WE didn't anything...
I'll lock him away for good.
Are you threatening me?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
And who's gonna find out?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Will he be alright?
No.
Presence.
This is wrong, Alan!
Alan...
We've got to fix this.
Oh... Hi.
You ever think back to how you started.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You got a gun?
You ever use it?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What?
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Oh... Yeah.
That was quite a thing you did today.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
Are you hungry?
Yes.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
So this is it?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Please....shoot me.
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
What?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
What is it?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
Dios mia.
TONY....TONY....
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Mary.
What'dya get?
So?
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yes sir.
I think he's sweet.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Don't stop.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
What happened?
It's all right, Chet.
That's your sister school, right?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
God, if Chet found out he'd...
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Good god, boy! Yell!
Again!  Louder!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Too bad.
You really think I should forget her?
She won't even see me, Pitts.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Any group pictures in the annual?
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Er  No.
Visit from my father.
How do we get out of here?
They are...they are everywhere.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
And what? These things are octopusses?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
We were talking about my schedule...
Not an option.
Maybe we lost them.
What other bunch?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I'm not rich people.
I don't know where it is!
Got it?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
What did you do the my kids!!
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Or maybe not.
Why don't you back off?
What the hell does that mean?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Check it out!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
That's new, isn't it?
Fucking A.
He's real bad, Nick.
You're back.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
No. None of that.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Where's it gone?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
What?
Okay.
How's the trailer?
Nick?
What are you doing?
You're going hunting?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You should have put that on last night.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Fucking A.
Pow?
You think we'll ever come back?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Here, here! This is it!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
See you Monday.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Down I would say... What would you say?
I'm not on the force anymore.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Hello Wade.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I want to stop aging.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I'm wasting time.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
You my partner?
Are you a cop?
I'm ready.
Wanna come?
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Hey, buddy...
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Sanchez...?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
Yeah.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Demolition Man.
You never want to find out.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Grandma, look at me!
Howdy, Jabez.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Loan shark -- hey?
What do you want?
Stevens!
-- in gold.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Where's everybody?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Where did it come from?
No, no! Give it to me!
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
I think his leg is broken.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Well -- what are we going to do?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez!
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
We must go on home, Jabez.
Worried!
You'll never change -- will you?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Why don't they come --
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
You know that, son.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Do you really think that?
Hello, Sheriff.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
You're all right, Argyle.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
One of yours?
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
What are you going to do?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you're an American?
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Go on.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
How do you know?
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
So whatsa deal?
These seats come out?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
So!  Sal is with you?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Okay, give us the women.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Okay, what do you give me?
What the hell you doin' back there?
What the fuck do you want?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Okay, is the vault open?
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Hello, Mulvaney here...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
What is it, Sam?
You all right?
I didn't eat any pizza.
Because I don't want cancer.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
To show that we're negotiating.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
We'd kill ourselves.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
We can't stay here.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Robbing a bank.
You could give up.
Of course not ...
Who the hell is that?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Where are we going?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Okay.
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
I don't know.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.

Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
Is that you, Domino?
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
Many times.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
No, you the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Make it plain.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I thank you.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Innocent!
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
How many you say?
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Can you pay me now?
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Tina, you are too slick.
Shit!  I forgot.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
You a blue-moon fool.
What?
Where are you going?
Be a man.
Just coolin'.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
That's what you think?
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
I know this.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
I didn't think so.
Pop asked you.
No, I'm not it.
You're it.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Would you like something to drink?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
HARRY? Are you okay?
What are you wearing?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
H A R R Y...
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Whoa. What was that?
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
You take that back!
Where did you learn that word?
No.
Nice jugs.
I don't know. Owwww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
I don't think so.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
But-
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Hey, it's Jessica.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
She's one of a kind.
Sorry, Charlie.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I thought I told you to get lost.
You had some questions.
So, when can we do it?
Well, something stinks.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
I'm so close I can feel it.
That's it. I'm done.
Okay.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
How was that?
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I am strong!
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
It's the big potato.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
And, take some more pictures.
Knock knock.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
You got the Extender?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
As the legend says.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Is he....?
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Always?
Liet?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
It burns.
THE PAIN!
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
Really?
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Bela, are you ready?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Sorry...
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
I've never seen anything like him!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
No!  A horror movie star!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Goddamn landlord.
I'm going to my mother's.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Did you find it boring?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
What was that?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
You're <u>sure</u>???
I thought this was a group effort.
B-but it's our money --
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What if I'm vomiting?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
What do you love her or something?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
You think she really likes him?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Sure.
Take him off the air.

Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Al!
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Eddie? ...
Send him away.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She had white shoes.
Who?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
What does this mean?
Cream rinse?
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Oh God, this is so weird.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Everybody hates me!
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Okay.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
This is going right up your ass.
Show business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
You would do this? You would actually --
I'm doing all right.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Why me?
You brought the girl!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Good-bye, brother!
Come on, Ma.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
That girl's an idiot.
Hi.
Mm.
We don't have foibles.
What does that have to do with... ?
Sign here, please.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
How'd it go?
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
What d'you got?
You're kidding, right?
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Tracy.
Looks good to me.
NO, that's fine
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Hello, Mr. M.
So Tracy?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
Hmm?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And how did you get in the school?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
What do you want, Jim?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
And she's super-nice
Are you crazy?
People can see this.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Hell, good luck!
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Did they deserve it today?
So you saved her.
Did you talk to Exley?
Captain, what do you want?
Dudley, what do you want?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Give me one minute.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
You know him?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Yeah, that's Stens.
Why?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Bud...
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
She's fine.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Should I?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
What do you mean?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
And?
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Why?
No... Where'd the tip come from?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
I need to speak to you.
So what's the point?
What's that for?
What are you going to do?
Decorated?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
What are you talking about?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Lynn Bracken.
I'm curious about you.
How was I?
I'll take your word for it.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
It seems like my Susan, but...
Let my Susie rest in peace!
My daughter was a virgin!
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Shut up!
Have we met before?
DePinto's dead.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
One of many people who would live a word with you.
I don't know what that means.
I'll pay you.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
Did you call anyone?
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Here?
Gimme that.
You're driving.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
He came in four minutes ago.
Who's calling?
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
That's fine.
What size?
I know, but--
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Than why can't you tell me.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
You should take this seriously.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Stacy--
I know.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Does that hurt?
The lingerie.
Are you sure you're safe?
Is it over?
Who?
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
DePinto?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
Good. You're just what I need right now.
I know.
I can't.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
Any idea what he looks like?
Yeah?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Hey!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Who would do that?
Sure, go ahead.
Dad!
How long can you stay?
Why don't you give 'em a call.
No, but they took my blender.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Ssh!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
They killed Rachel.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Tell me about it.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What happened?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Yes sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
No thank you.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
When were you least happy?
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
What else?
Say you're sick.
This is - what is this?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.
Why did he bring you?
It hurts too much.
You're wearing the thimble.
It's so cold.
Don't leave me!
Shall we be all right?
A broken car?
What kind of photographs?
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Good morning!
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
I believe I'm rather late.
How are you?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
No.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I think that's called looting.
Well, then ask him his name!
Hello.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Oh.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Right.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Could I have a cigarette?
He needn't disturb you.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
That's a different dress.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I'm still here.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
What do I do?
So I follow the wires?
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once… He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
What are you up to?
It's what I've learned.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
You've got a mustache.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
Kip?
No.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
So he popped the pane?
Where are you at least?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Are you...okay?
I've got something...
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
The Empress Death Mask.
But Roki said--
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
You want me to pick up a painting?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
Nice spot.
True enough.
You were afraid of heights?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
We did it.
The big job.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Peoples China Bank.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
You have something in mind?
Four billion dollars.
That's because you grew up rich.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Jesus.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Gin, really.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Oh, it is.
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You'll just have to have faith.
How does someone get meningitis?
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Five million dollars?
And get someone to help around the house.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
What now?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Hey.  I like working with you.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
What kind of things come up?
And if you had to guess ...
So why would PG&E offer it?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Fuck Kurt.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
You come to the right place.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Yeah.  A real moron.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
Hey -- those are my files --
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
What're you doing?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
What are you doing here?
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
And I miss you.
No, I need my car --
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
Someone stole my stuff.
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Yes, My Lord.
You must survive, Luke.
... Luke, you must not go.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Yes, Your Highness?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
I don't know what he's talking about.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
That was no earthquake.
Stop that.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
I was worried about you.
This ought to be good.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
I'll take what's mine now.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
What's going on?
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Someone's falling.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Closer?!
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Jabba the Hutt?
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
That they are.
Yes, My Lord.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Zira, are you mad?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
What, Lewis?
Primitive?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Cuervo...?
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Where is he?
Oh Cuervo...
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Shit.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
See you in hell, Snake.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Where do I put ashore?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
She's in the green.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Getting ready to invade.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Later.
Is that what I think it is?
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
What are they?
Don't follow me.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
How do we get out of here?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Perceval, you have returned!
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
He can be no other.
I want to thank you.
How? Where?
What?!
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
What is this place, Merlin?
Father...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why?
Me?
To me? But why?
There are things about love--
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
A lovestruck page!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
You provoke me, Merlin.
Now you must pay me.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Hello?
Hi
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Phonograph.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Would you like some more coffee?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Thank you.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Are you sure?
Pretty close?
About my daughter?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Have you told him what's happening?
Is she gonna die?
What did you do today?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Where?
You know how?
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
I don't want it.
All done.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
You just missed them.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
No now.
You speak Latin?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
The Lord be with you.
What is it?
Can you give her something?
Have we met?
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Are you comfortable Regan?
How old are you?
What about tomorrow?
What're you saying, Charlie?
Maybe next time.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Beasley.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
Jack.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
No, I mean it.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
What's that?
No.
Make it collect.
I thought we had separate rooms.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
He's drunk.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What's the matter with you?
What the hell are you doing?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
The party's over.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
What disease?
You don't know?
What?
Jack, you're on television.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
You weren't there.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Actually, that's my stage name.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
You're an hour and a half late.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
So?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
It's orange!
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead.
Hey, will you look at that?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
How come?
Thanks.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
It went well tonight.
And you don't?
Is that the way it is?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Forget it.
He do that every year?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
You were good.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
He had a mind that escalated things.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
What kind?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Yeah.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
The recent past.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
What did he do?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Perfect fit.
Hey, bro ...
Thanks, Pollux.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
No.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
How did he expect to do that?
I took it from my fake husband.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
How's Loomis?
Go on.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Which ear was it?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
What are you -- stupid?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Nothing.
-- Yes.
Where's Jamie?
I'll deal with her later.
Her assistant?
No...
Adelle?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Take you, for instance...
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Rise...and...shine...!
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
They did a pretty good job.
Do you like kids?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Where do I go now?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Look, I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Where were you?
Jack...don’t even start...
What are you doing?
Why not?
Here you go...
She’s your dog, Jack.
Hello!
Uh...that baby’s crying...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Our life in a nutshell...
You mean this chocolate cake?
Thank you...
Maybe I should wait...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Jack...can we afford all this?
I need to tell you something.
This place is a perk, Kate.
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Don’t do that...
Kate...
Not by a long shot.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
Are you alright?
We're working as hard as we can --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Where...where am I?
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Ben, come in.
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
What?
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Come on, Ben, come on...
<u>Ben</u> did this?
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
What are you doing?
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
You said it was urgent.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
What is it?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
Doctor...
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Doctor, what's wrong?
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
How does it look, Doctor?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Atomic fuel?
Any reserve air?
What happened?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
What is it, Skipper?
What's wrong, Skipper?
How's it look?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...Would it kill you to say something?
Unguent.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
One of us pays the other for half.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
That's right. And we need more money.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Yah!
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Norstars.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
No kiddin'?
Stan and I're okay.
We're good to loan in.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
Hiya, Lou.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
Yah, that's a good one.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...What can I get ya?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
Oh. Geez.
And this guy is...
Gustafson's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Was it reasonable?
Yah, I guess.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
We need to talk.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
It means it was homemade.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
Look, this is a bad time...
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
Make sure.
Uh ... nah.
When?
I don't know.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
No.
Yeah?
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Let go of me!
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
... and you come home to this.
You were in here last Thursday night.
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Tell the other person how you feel.
I mean -- for a living.
What?
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
I don't follow...
Would that be a problem?
What's that?
What?
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
Same here.
What?
Alive or dead?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
What is this place?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Tyler...
I feel sick.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
You want out?
Defuse the bomb?
NO...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why... why... why... ?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
I'm doing this for us.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Appreciate something.
Who is this?
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Ain't that something?
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Would you rather be dead?
Yeah, how?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
What about that?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
May we come in?
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
You mean Alex Browning.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Kalarjian?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
What is it?  What are you?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What on Earth are they doing?
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Remember the departure time?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
What are you doing?
You mean the snake?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
That's what I'm here for.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
Are they going to torture us?
Intelligence work.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Are you okay?
Why'd they want us?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
What was that?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long have you been setting up?
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I'm sorry.
<u>What</u>!
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What are you two up to?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Parry?
What if I was a relative?
You a friend of Parry's?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
.....Me neither.
How un-sixties of you.
Yes.
A list.
So how do we do this?
Oh, Lydia!
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Have I died?
Where am I?
... Do you know who I am?
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Him...?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Parry...
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
.....What are you doing?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
You a fag too?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Parry Parry?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Excuse me...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
Is it my turn again?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Sure...
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Just finish eating.
What's your name?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No substitutions.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I don't make the rules.
Wasn't it, ladies?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Sorry.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Well...  I better let you...
Maybe you better stay, then.
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
How long have you been staying here?
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Where is she, anyway?
What have you been doing since then?
Hello...
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Catherine...
No, it isn't what I think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
No, don't do that...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Robert, do you mind?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
Robert, I think you better just...
What kind of doggy is that?
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
You better hold onto your tongue!
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Pardon me?
Miss Dupea.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
Do you have a name?
Wussup?
So you got a girl?
How you treat them?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Come down!
Wha'?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I think he's 18 or 17.
Like this?
You looking for somebody?
You here to see somebody?
My friend told me she lived around here.
How do I know you're not lying.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
Would you like me to change anything?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Maybe tonight?
I wasn't asking.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's two.
Margaret.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
For sure?
You're in the Records Room.
Oh my God!
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Right.
Has he?
He sighs.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
They busted me last week.
Sure you did.
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Did you hear something?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
She's cute as a button.
That's a strange combination.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Why do you keep doing this?
Alan's in Utah.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Thanks for the great time.
What are you talking about?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
What are you talking about?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Don't worry, I can take it.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
I would, actually.
Your call is come through.
Fletch.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Gummy and two cops...
How could you call him?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You'll have it.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Actually, you may take it all now.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
That was close...
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Three hundred.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Spunk, come back...
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Zuzu, wake up...
Are you okay?
My axe!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Are you okay?
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Yeah, go on...
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Like me.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
I'm still the king!
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
How's everything?
B.O.C.A.
Sal --
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
It's your problem.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Comment va-t-elle?
Le sommes nous?
Sale boulot.
Il est en retard.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
You're in show business.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Why not?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
What about Sal?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Pass.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
It was a crematorium.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
How was your tour?
He did.
I'm off.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Deleon.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
I'm scared.
You ready?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
It's really you, isn't it?
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
What?
On the job?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
But that's tomorrow.
She just died, your mother just died?
When?
Murdered?  Why?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Got it.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
Please, Dad, just do it.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
She makes ten.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Wife around?
Going?  How do you mean?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
What was that?
How about a roll in the hay?
How do we do it?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
What's the matter?!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Which one is it?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
This is too painful to look at.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
What?
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Yes!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Steven...
What do you want?
You need to leave.
Steven buggin' you?
Ed...
Get up!
What are you doing?
Randy, c'mon!
Are you crazy?!
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
How many times do you want to hear this?
I've told you the truth.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
That's disgusting.
Have you seen Tamara?
No thanks.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Well...how do you feel?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
But I thought...
What's that?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
What a beautiful day.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Rennie...
Rennie...??
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
Big mess every time.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Say it again.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
We must abandon.
That's awful.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
He carries a gun.
He'll hate it.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
What about her?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
What?
We're able to surprise each other.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
See, Daddy.
See, Daddy.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I am really, deeply sorry.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Life is good.
A thousand things.
Life is true.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Let's not start that again.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You're charming the boy.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Then they lost?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
'm not worried about this kid.
Yessiree, Bob.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
So does Elliot.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
So do I. Over and over.
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Yes.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Oww!
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No violence, please.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
The fools!  Sorry...
Perhaps some tea?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Who are you trying to convince?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
We don't have the manpower.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Hello.
What's wrong with it?
It needs work.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
It's not too late to back out.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Let's get out of here.
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
We can't stay here.
They'll recognize me.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
How the hell did you get here.
I have your samples ready.
Where are you going?
Vincent...Vincent...

Yeah.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Does it have a name?
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
We'll try again.
You okay?
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
Just like old times?
Boring.
Wait... give me a minute.
How was it?
$250,000 right off the top.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Doc...
I don't want to go there.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
Texas is a big state.
Do you mean that?
There may be a hunting party.
That would be the first time.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Are you hungry?
No scars?
No more about Beynon.
Can we make it?
I don't know.
So what?
Come on, come on.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Can I help you?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Suit yourself.
Two.
Let's just get to the border.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You got it.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
What's it got to do with you?
What about the brakes?
I made a mistake.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Jack?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Confidential, like.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
No, don't Jack, don't.
Everyhing go off all right?
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What kind of entertaining?
That's why you waited for me.
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
How's school?
Oh, what you doing now?
It just would. He was always the same.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
See you later.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Are you a traveller?
Will this do?
What is it?
What'll they do to him?
What you going to do?
Are you awake?
Do you want breakfast?
Do us a favour?
You coming back?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Meaning what?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
What's that?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
I...
...that's right...
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Starting up.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You fucking build it!  Men come...
...you're absolutely right.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
As an idea.
No.
You didn't?
You're going to steal the leads?
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Dave.
They're going to come to everyone.
I didn't ask to be.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
Why?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
Everything I...you know...
A waste of time?  Why?
They aren't?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Will you excuse...
Will you excuse us please?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Shelly: get in the office.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Who told you...?
Aaronow...
Mr. Levene...?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I will close.
I will close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Alright.
Can't do it.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Mmm.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I...
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Why?
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the leads?
Fuck you, Dave...
"Always be closing..."
Oh, Christ.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
The monthly interview...?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
I'm sorry...?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Yes.
Who did she call?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
No, Jim.
I can't regotiate.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
Fuckin' asshole.
Guess what the Machine did?
You hear what I said?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
Have a good trip.
They didn't get the contracts.
They took some of the con...
Are you alright?
Did you like your party?
What took so long?
What if we don't pay?
Bought at the airport.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
He is weak.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
The 'patrone' is here.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Where's my wife?
You're going to talk to him now.
Rocco!
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
It might show.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Kay.
Does it feel like a boy?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
There are still things I have to do.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Trust me; do as I ask.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
We'll try.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
You're sure of that?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Or would you prefer a beer?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Did you kill anyone?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Does that surprise you?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Can I see what you did so far?
Sorry.  Not today.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Why not?
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
This was World War I?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
No.  The girl.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
It's not like her.
That only leaves the rest.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Why?
You coming, Boone?
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Jimmy.  How are you?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
A boost. A big boost ...
It seems she neglected to mention it
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
I know you.
Not my girl anymore
Who is it -- ?
Yeah.
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
How you know that?
oh.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
You goin' home?
You all right -- ?
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Hey, you want something to eat ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
What are you doing here?
You hear me?
Shadow games ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
Having fun, Kip?
You okay -- ?
Come here -
Toby...
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Buy you a drink?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
What the hell's that -- ?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
The alarms go off ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
What -- ?
Is he still working here ?
Some crew you got ...
You need him...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
How old are you now, Toby?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
How come ... ?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Why don't you leave him alone?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Anybody!  You understand?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
The bag with the envelopes.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
Henry.  Wake up.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What about the schools?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Paulie's gonna make him?
You know what to do?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
I hate to do dishes.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Did he say what they're asking him about?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
You want a partner?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
She didn't do it again did she?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
When's the arraignment?
Who'd you call?
How's the woman?
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Why didn't you yoke him?
You're kiddin' me.
What class?
Hi.
Oh, right.
Jesus.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
Did she get my Double Burger?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I don't think I...Larry?
Will you take a check?
What class did you say that was?
How'd you like that course?
Codebreaking.
Where is it touching you?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Shall we start the, uh...
Get out, Will.
No.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
What are you smiling at?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Can we do it at my office?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And confuse him--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
Where're you going?
Why there?
How about one now?
What do you want to do?
Who is he?
I could go for a Whopper.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I might understand that.
That's very presumptuous.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Why not?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
I been there. I played my hand.
You want to read it?
Gotta go with the belt there...
I know.
I know.
I know.
That's what you want?
Good for you. Congratulations.
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Five minutes.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
Free?
Yeah.
I want to meet them.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
When?
Do you play the piano?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Yeah.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Lots must a died, too.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
That's the way it is.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
That cut you got?
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
She's settlin'.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
What's the matter?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
What's the matter, Grampa?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you going?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
I like the tent better.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
They know he got hit in the face.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
What is it?
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
You mean get off my own land?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
How you get all this money?
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Now you done it! You busted it!
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
What do you do?
You do not.
--Stop it--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Bob...
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
It's always the little things.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Yes.
Are you there?
Flowers. That's funny.
Shoulda brought my gun.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Which would you rather...?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
...About five years now.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Thank you, no.
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Throw that away.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They're not happy, sir.
They blame you for the compromise.
They were very upset.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
What the hell happened to you?
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
This is Annie MacLean.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
Doesn't matter.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
You okay?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Shit.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Everything under control?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
I don't believe this!
Did he tell you that?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Nothing.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
What did you say?
Started what?
When? Tonight?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
You've got to stop doing that?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Yes?
Was the trip okay?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
What choice!!?
Where does this go, Diane?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Mixed salad.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Would you let me ride your horse?
Mmm. An editor.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
"... and I said that"...
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Hey, darlin'.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Oh yeah? What's that?
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
One-handed!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
How was school?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
What the hell are you doing?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah.
And if I win?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Shit!!
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Excuse me.
There's a new virus in the database.
Colonel who?
Never fear. I is here.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Hello?
Phreak?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Purpose of visit?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
What?
So?
When did you find this out?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Who's that?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Shit!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
When did this happen?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Why not?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Has he been prepped?
What the hell did this?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Hi.
Had enough?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
What are you doing out here alone?
You don't believe that do you?
Hi Rachel.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Hell of a night.
Where are you going?
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Get the outside shutters.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Oh Christ. Doc...
Thank you.
Sort of.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
You're going to be late!
Why didn't you wait for me?
It's been totally charted.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What time?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Fantastic. Totally.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
A man wouldn't do that...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Sure...
You have the wrong feeling.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Okay. Later.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Yes, I am.
Promise?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Laurie, you come with us...
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
I've given them his profile.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
There's nothing else I can do.
Ever done anything like this before?
I see.
It means... I see.
Pull up to the entrance!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Yeah.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
What?
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
I can't resist.
Is this your first job?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
You're Holly.
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
It's really sad.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
How ya doin', man?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Like, uh...?
Hi.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
No!  No...
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Isn't that beautiful?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
They're fantastic.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Oh, Mom!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
How about something to eat?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
N-n-no, not that.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
It was on your shirt!
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yes!
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
This is the second opinion.
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Okay, okay.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, Hannah!
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
What's the matter?
Good.
Oh, so loosely.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Can we, can we go?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
God!
It was a terrible evening.
People change...you know.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
No, I haven't.
You're okay, though, huh?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Really?
Oh, God!
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Hi.  How you doin'?
Tch.
Mickey?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Uh-huh.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
A reward...
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Well.  Word gets around.
It wasn't my day.
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Yes?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Who would that be.
C'mon, pal.
How was America?
<u>Do</u> it...
He escaped...
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
He is...?
...here's to child abuse!
Sir:
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
What is that supposed to mean...?
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Give it up.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
...may be the heat....
Indeed we were.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Look what they put her on...
I am on the track of...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
What're they on about?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Yes.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Howdy Pouty.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
What are you doing?
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Sorry Veronica.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
I said I was sorry.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
What are you doing?
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Probably....
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Hello!
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
But, we're all going to Heaven!
What?
Let's go overseas . . .
Poor Father . . .
Mummy!
Are you a dream too?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
No.
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret... what the fuck...?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Have we met?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
What did you just say?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Hey buddy!
Do you know where you are?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Last week...
You okay?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
I...
The homeless!
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
I snuck in.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
It's not right, Gale...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Helluva story!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Where are these toys of yours?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
I found a cent!
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Where'd he go?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
How was lunch?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
He wants to see me!
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
What?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Just reduced.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Let's follow 'em.
Shit!
Neil, do you mind?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
Is it a king or a queen?
Even better.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Lieutenant?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Anything from the bank?
Good evening, Lieutenant.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
You?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Sing.
I'm leaving.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
What are we doing here?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
You can go first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Good evening.
You didn't answer my question.
Why not?
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
It has to be.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
You get anything on Smith?
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Not if they're looking at something else.
Then we might as well die rich.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
He needs a doctor.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
What the fuck is that?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
What do you want?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
All right.  Now the second one.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Mine, too.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Now we can do whatever we want.
What happened?
Where are they?
That's not enough.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
It's mine.  Talley.
What are you people going to do?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
How about you and your sister?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Can you open them?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Are the disks still in your room?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Paul!
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The United Nations are still here.
I will see what I can do.
We must go to the Diplomat.
When?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Let's go.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Excuse me.
You have our cards.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Thomas wants advice?
No.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
The president has been murdered.
This won't do.
Any luck?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
What does it matter.
A little longer, Paul?
Oh, my babies.
Twelve are dead.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
How much beer?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Why the hurry, Roger?
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
Not yet.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
What are you playing here, Price?
There must be some other way out.
I'm sorry --
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Oh, really: who?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
What is it? What's in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
If you know where it is, get there!
What? Deep down inside?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
You hear somebody?
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
What?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- wit...nesses --
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
-- the window and door grates --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Fascinated.
Well, I don't.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Oh, no.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Pritchett: what is going on?
Sara...?
We don't have proof of that.
Are you all right?
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
By freeing them.
Can I do it again tonight?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
I can't move!
Mommy please help me!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
It's just going to take a while.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
Whoa there...
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Are you all right?
I think we should do it.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Your daughter's been taken.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
This isn't happening...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Do you mind if I borrow it?
What do you mean?
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
Every day.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Uh-huh.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Yes.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
How do we start?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Hmmmm.....
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Did I miss anything?
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
That was close....
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Welcome back to Vinci.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
What the hell....
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Hudson, don't you understand...
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh Hudson...
I hope you know what....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
I wanna know...
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Bunny, not you too?
This is the worst night...
Don't I know you...
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
Why does this have to be so hard...
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
That smart?!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
You're from Muncie?!
...You know! For kids!
Confused?
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...Huh?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
...The people look like ants.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
You mean you know about this?
...You son of a --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
I filed it yesterday.
You can't print that!
How long've you been down here?
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
...Geez.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
...You don't?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz, you know I never --
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
...This'll only take a moment.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
You're fired.
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Finally.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
She's got other problems, of course...
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
But, Mrs. Rand --
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
You're single?
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I wish I hadn't heard --
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Can't I take it for you?
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I heard you playing.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I told you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
An accident at the mill?
In other words, I'm on trial.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
You're staring at me.
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Don't be dim.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Damn it, Ben --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
Good shit.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
You okay?
I saw you on your bike today.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I used to know how to cook.
Here you are.
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
What do you mean?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
I do.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Geometry?
Where you going?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Well, you can...
Yeah.
I love you.
Nice kid.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
You did your homework, Officer.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
Duggar called him?
Not really.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll call him now.
Randy Stetz?
Are you sure about that?
He's just rattling your cage.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Your friend's all business.
Will...I...
Will.
Did you love her?
You heard me that time.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Thought I smelled something.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
No...
She wouldn't tell me!
It was like some big fucking secret!
She used some stupid code name.
No game.
You gave her gifts.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Yes.  Like that.
So you have the answers...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I couldn't prevent it.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
And if I cut my hair again?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
I want more.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
They would have killed you -
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What do you want from me?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You really want to be with them?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
We belong in hell.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Why do you do this Lestat?
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
No... You come back to me Louis...
And they frighten you?
I have to go now Lestat...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
You loved Yvette...
But why did you tell her?
No... it can't end like that...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
You promise to care for her then?
And the child who did die?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Storm season?
Get lost, you scared me.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I thought you were out of town!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
No.
Karla!
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
There's no way to lock it.
Oh, god, it's you --
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, I can't...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
The shower again?
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It was one year ago...
Julie? What's wrong?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Is there a problem here?
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
To a great weekend --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
You guys lost?
What's going on?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
We will see who is the first to die.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Where's Thea?
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
I felt he did not like me.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Your daughter is ill.
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
Theodosia --
Daughter -- my daughter --
You're crying. Why?
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Well, tell, him.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Get that ladder up here.
Stand back.
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
What?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Goodbye, everybody!
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Uh-huh.
Hmmm . . .
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
How's that?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
George.
What gives?
George, can I see you for a second?
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Made up your mind yet?
I'm not very good at this.
Well, why don't you say it?
Eighteen.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Oh, no.
If I told you it might not come true.
Ouch!
George . . . George . . . George . . .
After that, who cares?
Oh, Mary . . .
Have fun.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
You forgot something.
You can?
Great!  Find one for me.
Get on the rocks!
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Why not?
Shut up.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
The lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
Throw it.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Tina!
What is it?  What's there?
Chief....
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
What about that camera?
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Wait a minute....
It came up during the meeting.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
The what?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Let's get the kid home.
Need a ride?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Where's my day book?
I know what you're going to say.
What're you going to do today?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Are you serious?
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Some people.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
About damn time.
What is it?
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
I don't care.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Not tonight.
Who wouldn't.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
I want Fruit Loops!
You're going sailing.
Yeah.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Be reasonable, please....
We're ready for you.
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Sure am.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Well, not much longer to go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Yeah.
How come?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Where are you going?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Michael...
How the hell did it get in here?
Kathryn...
Recovering nicely.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
That's right.
Me.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Let's hope he knows that.
Why?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
How's sleeping beauty?
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Philip.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Musclehead?
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
How come?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Sean, do you have herpes?
Gotta sneeze.
Did you see that?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Make sure you put this back.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Polar bears.
The world's southern most reaches.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
How'd you do in school?
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Sure.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
Where are you going?
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
No fair, I'm not armed.
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Where is she?
Henny Youngman....
All he did was kiss me....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
That hurt....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
In a minute....
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I want you to get out of the water....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
You could teach...You could....
Promise me you'll be all right....
Can you just go off...?
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It's just like driving a car....
You promised me a drink....
Want to go for a little ride?
Hurry!
I hope she's a good sailor....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Matt?
I don't know what the hell to say....
Still tagging conch?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
I wish there was something I could do....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
They won't fight with me....
Bad boy....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Bring her to starboard.
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I'm coming...How close is it?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Holy Christ....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Cow tipping?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
The van?
Did you bring it with you?
What do you think?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Why?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Did he shut you down?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Did I say he did?
She wasn't lying about the van.
Sure.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
Ease off, John ..
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Where's your watch?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Did he get you the job?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I know what a "witness" is.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Yes, Sir.
You must have some idea about him.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
No.
Oh.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Why?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
He doesn't need my help.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Why?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
What does that mean?
You think he still loves her?
Is that Margie?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
He's happy, darlin ..
You want something, darling?
She married some English prick.
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Listen to me!
Didn't hear it.
Don't let him stay up too late.
He's asleep, right?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
No no...
Now what did you lose?
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Wonder what he said.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
That took guts.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Don't worry about it, boss.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
If I said that, would you stay?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
It's my fault.
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't know --
I don't like to give up.
What about medical?
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Denver is where he should be.
Not right now, Jerry.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
At last I find you.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Is that your porty or mine?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
I'll get you some quick work --
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
You don't want to go home, do you?
That's an answer.
I think so.
I have to ask.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
How can I make your life better?
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
You wanted smaller.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
One-two-three, swing.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
ERRR-IIIC!
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
That's him. That’s Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
Well what?
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
He could have died.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
You had the phone the whole time?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
Is it a rex?
I CAN GET HIM!
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
I'd better get going.
Eric, your parents are both here.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Amanda!
How did you know?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Sorry.  We were saying?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Where do you think you're going?!
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
She's gutty.
?!
We can't stay in here!
Something's wrong.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Oh, God.
These formations.  They're dried --
So what's your story, Nick?
What?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
The what?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Come on, let's go.
It's anti-nature.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Dino droppings?
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Why not?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I read your book.
Tim.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Oh my God!
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
That's not funny.
Fifty.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
I don't know...
He wets the bed?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Add it to the list.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
You know how to use one of those?
We're down to seven minutes.
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Will you do me a favor then?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
It's my last and final one.
A true friend would do it.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Gabriela ...?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
Do you?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
What's the matter?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Ludwig.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Father!
I'm sorry ...
Can you fly?
There's a light up ahead.
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Why?
What's that?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Mm.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Why isn't he locked up?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Who?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
It's kind of late.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
What?
Then, close the case.
Where, how?
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Have you discussed this with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Town Police.
No.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Well?
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Are you closing the case?
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Where is the child?
What do you have here, Billy?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What do you like best about her?
You're late.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Mom, I mean dad...
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Daddy?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Wow!
Is that really your chair?
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
What don't you understand, pal?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
So do I.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
And how did you find his work?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
I consider it less my failure than his.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Where are you going?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Wow!
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
I lost him?  I lost him?
What if I fight it?
I'll take my chances.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Yeah.
How many?
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Hey, that's terrific.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Please, come, Holiness.
Mama, my story.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Yes.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Your father had been very sick.
I will be back in a few days.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
How big is Tibet's army?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Please, come in, so cold.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
You will not come?
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
You are unharmed?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
No.
I haven't broken any laws.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
Jesus Christ!!
I'm laying a spring trap!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
No!
At school they'd always say "go" first.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
I'm okay.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
It's too dangerous for--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
He thinks they're what?
You okay?  Kelly?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Well.  Goodnight.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Calm down.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
It can't work.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
You sure?  I don't mind...
If I'm ever in New York...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
It was... something meeting you.
You think?
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Are they feeding?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
You said nobody came in here!
He's done.  He's dying.
Thanks for your help.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
What?
They don't believe her.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
What was that?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Kelly.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
<u>You</u>?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Myra.
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
No. He won't come after me.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Five... so far.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
Yes.
They all were.
He kills w-
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
What did you do?
So you ran away...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Thank you, Clarice.
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Yes, miss.
Why didn't you bury those people?
He did?
What?!
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
And my compliments to you...
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
How far is it, scout?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
That is the truth!
Then what?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Got a reason to stay.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Gold could be arranged.
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Qui vive?
Le mot d'ordre?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Was there such a thing?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
We're getting out of here just in time.
I thought they were your friends?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Jesus Christ...
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Sixpack?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
What can we do?
We're on backup air.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
We made it!
What about our quota?
Something wrong, Cobb?
What's wrong with it?
Shut up, all of you.
Oh, God, she's out there...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
If he had his blinkers on--
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What the?...
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Typhoon?!
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
I'm going to try to remove it.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
What on earth's the matter with you?
What is it?
The shack...
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
I thought this was a pub.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
You all right back there, mate?
What are you doing?
Is he on his own?
It's not him, Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
So do you know these geezers well?
Yeah, one of them's out.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
I will.
And?
I can't help you, Plank.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
What have you come as?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
I hear they're closing that post down.
That the word on our boy?
You got a cause of death?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Suppose not.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
Where'd he get all this?
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Well--
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Mikey--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
So where does that put us?
Seriously.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
That where he was shot?
This is an official visit, then--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Right.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
You have somebody else out there?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
This girl has a child?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
That so?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
No.
Bledso
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Charley Wade.
Steve called for you.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
She finally got in--
Morning, Sheriff.
Time marches on.
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
Something wrong?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
He's all yours.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Your boy, there--
We thought we were something, didn't we?
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah?
Wow.
We start from scratch--
They got telephones.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
I know you?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
How much?
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Nix.
Thanks, Billy.
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
I don't want him getting in the way.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Oh Christ.
Stuff?
It's okay.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Oh God!
Valentin?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Where the fuck is he?
Are you finished with me?
Shit.
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Any movie stars buried here?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Are you satisfied now?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
You need an ambulance.
Harry D'Amour.
Are they all in the business?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
How the fuck do you do that?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
What is?
Nix! Nix!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Yeah, they told me.
Ok.
What are you doing here?
How long have you been married?
Try twenty-five.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I know.
Nice one.
You think so?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Harris?
Do you like massage?
My stockings.
Hi, Lydia.
Uh, no.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Yeah.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Hello? Yes?
No, what are you talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Do you think it's done?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh, the record company sent these...
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
John! What are you doing here?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Peter, where are you?
I'm still shaking.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
You'll do it?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
So...we won?
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Yes... and you are?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I'll bet.
So...what did you think of the tape.
We need to talk.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
Why did he try to kill me?
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
What are you looking for exactly?
You okay?
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
There's nothing else here.
Are you alright?
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Plenty of time.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
It's useless...look at him.
He can see you Thursday.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
What do you mean by that?
Thanks for handling this.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
No I don't.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
That's not it.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
Which one for tomorrow?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
I can take it.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Hello.
Nah.
That too tight?
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No.
You do.
I know.  But chances are...
Well, what do you know.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
So...does it hurt?
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I don't have to do what you say.
What's that?
That's it, give it your best shot.
You having fun?
Early night for you, isn't it?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Four.
When'd you get this?
You finish the reading for E-con?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Sorry about your game.
Who was that?
You weren't at my game.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least you got your priorities straight.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Actually, I don't...
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
You asked me what was missing.
From basketball.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
One game.  One-on-one.
You're out of your mind.
Zeke.
We should head over.
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Yeah.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Why not?
You work too hard, Pop.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Sorry.
Why?
What are you doing here?
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
No need for braces, Donnie.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Hello?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Oh, she's fine.
It was scary though.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
For what?
What?
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yeah.
You mind if I check things back here?
About two years ago.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
No.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Billingsley's?
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
So you've done it --
Why not?
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
You really use strong language.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
It's ok.
Just say no.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Where's Richard and Julia?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
C'mon guys, settle down --
Can you hold it?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
You mind your own bussines.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
What is that?
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Get a girlfriend.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
...cocksucker....
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
All it takes is one second?
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Do you have your masters?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Is he in pain?
He's in here --?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
It's interesting.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
What? What? What now?
There's no disturbance.
I AM CALM.
I didn't do anything.
You on any medication?
--- What was that?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
What the hell is this Marcie?
...you know...
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Stanley?
-- did she talk to you?
No.  No.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Was there anyone that I know?
Who?
hey.
Just once.
I don't.
I don't know....
I love you so much.
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
...Jimmy...
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Can I come in?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
What does that mean?
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Phone number.
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
I don't have regular classes anymore.
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
..sorry...
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
What -- ?
I am preparing for a ball!
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
It can.  I know the way.
More wine!!
But --
Bloody hell...
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Where are we?
Mother of God!
And why are you so glum?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But why?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
D'Artagnan, unready?
It worked!
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
It's been too long.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is everything to me.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Where are you going?
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Recent hours have been a shock.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
One for all.  All for one.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
A personal nature?
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty...?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
You dead yet?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Shall I leave?
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Find out for me.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
What's this?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Well don't you think that's odd?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Yeah?
Something I don't already know?
Where is he?!!
Speak of the devil.
So where are you from?
Why did you set me up?
What exactly did you see?
Jesus, man...
Holy shit -
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Are you a regular there?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Don't you guys ever knock?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I wouldn't presume to try.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Get me a plane...
It's not over yet.
Will?
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Parking permits...
Will...?
Where the hell's Graham!
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
You worked out well.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You will tell the truth?
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
Yeah...
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
'Intimate? !"
What happened to them?
No.
He asked how you are.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Is Crawford going with you?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Thanks for the lift.
What do you want?
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
She got all right?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Pictures?
Do you dream much, Will?
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Why does it feel good?
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Andy!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
They're having a laugh...
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
So how can I help you...?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
B-but I have them.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hi...
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
It's so dirty.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Goals are important.
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
"Burlesque"?
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
I saw Michael!
Why is he saying these things?!
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
A -- a tourist.
We'll need a search running.
The sewers.  Of course.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
There's something about him, isn't there?
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Yes.
All right --
What is he doing?
Morpheus...
Right now?
What the fuck do they want with me?!
No way, no way, this is crazy.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
... am I dead?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Did you believe in them too?
Hello?
You're the Oracle?
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
How did you do that?
Who is?
From what?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Get this thing out of me!
Is it?
Should I be?
Did you go to her?
Are you all right?
Go!
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
Can you fly that thing.
You don't have...
Where is it?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
They've burned through the outer shields.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Yeah.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
No.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Who's the girl?
Panther...
What happened to you Flash?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Keep your mouth shut.
Back so soon.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
How much?
You're really crazy.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Hey, where you been?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
It's still sick.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
What's the matter with this kid?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Hey... you got stereo.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
How much?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Oh, the goddam party --
Yeah, but --
...This shit's not bad.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
What are you eating.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Hello, Beautiful.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Hot or cold.
No, I don't --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
'Joe...'
Have we met?
No.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Yeah, that's what he said.
Can't, sistah.
Not time yet.
Don' need you okayin'.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Black.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
'Big'?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
Yes?
Very well, I'll watch.
She's in a great deal of pain.
I appreciate you --
Has her pain abated?
Did you like making love to me?
Where are you going?
I - uh --
I'm still here.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
There's one to every rule.
I want to live.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
What way would you put it?
I'm sorry, Bill --
What's okay?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Are you threatening me?
Okay.
I told you to shut up.
He is --
An offense --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
You are --?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
This one.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Drew's aboard?
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Do you love Drew?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
You know each other?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where is he?
I don't know, I can't say --
Are you relieved?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Nothing lasts.
I've got patients coming in --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
You said you liked me.
38.
Well, what then?
That's it?
How long have I been here?
What makes you think he's my friend?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Where'd you get it?
Do you remember me?
Why?
You don't remember me.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Your wife?
It's not easy to be calm when -
His name was Jimmy.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
What does he want?
I'm not.
Don't talk about my wife.
Don't say another fucking word!
They're not looking for him.
Dying.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Shut your mouth!
This is your car.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Lenny, is that you?
You really want to find this guy?
I don't think so.
Natalie? Natalie who?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Why's that?
She couldn't.
What sort of questions?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
Why?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
What cop?
Bullshit.							*
What was it for?							   *
Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
And...?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Sure.
I got the item.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Where's she now?
I insist.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I forgot the napkins.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
And there's Dmitri...
Stevens?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
So?
How much we looking for?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Go ahead.
Hello?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
So?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
You mean with the flowers...?
And as an investment in the future...
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Then what were we talking to you for?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
What the hell did you do?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You ain't coming to work?
What you gonna do back there, East?
You think I'm lying!
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
For money.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
What for?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You're what?
You want me to leave?
Here. Don't even thank me.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
The kids? Why are they...
Yeah.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
It's there!
Want me to take over?
What?
Who?
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
DAD!
Those mountains? are they?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Girlfriend?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
How's it feel?
Just Erich.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Get the... midnight... express.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
We go back.
It's already been cut.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Hishradyo.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
There's some weird shit here.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
The Department of Public Health...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
But the power...
He didn't do it!
Just inner chambers...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Honey, just leave it.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Rub it on the windows!
Talk to me.
No...
Hello.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
What's it about?
But what?
The profanity bothers you?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Thank you so much.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Then who did?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Well, it certainly says you.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
You've been out of your room.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
What things?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Could be the weight of the snow.
Just leave it, all right?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Answer me a couple things?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Newspapers?
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I thought you were going to dinner.
How grateful?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You picked another winner!
Sort it all out.
What are you talking about?
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
It is, Billy.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Do you know me?
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Hola..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
What's you name?
They've got a book for this?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times?
-- his left jacket pocket.
I managed.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Like what?
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
Excuse me?
Very.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
..I'm fine..and you?
It's the transponder.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
A visit from an old friend.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
You knew about Jim?
Is he serious?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
May I come in?
Kittridge...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
IMF mainframe.
Zero body count.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Then what am I doing here?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
Why not?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
I usually am.
What's going on?
Why don't you take a look?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes...  Itís him.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
The Shawfish?
I don't wanna talk about it.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
You're not sleepy?
Johnny Cammareri.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
What are you doing here?
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
It's wrong to just let them go.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Yes!
Why didn't he call himself?
Why?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
How'd he die?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Why you talking to me?
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
I can't believe what is happening.
I was dead.
What about Johnny?
What?
What? What have we done?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Snap out of it!
But that's cause he don't know!
Hi.
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
What's the matter?
This is your place.
I'm freezing to death.
He's coming.
Hi Loretta.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
You never have dessert.
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
Why not?
How's the mother?
Hi.
He's with his dying mother!
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
I know.
Talk to him.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Maybe I should go?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Yes?
Do you have a girlfriend?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
People home.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
I'm freezing
Yes.
Rita. Rita.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
How do you know she is a witch?
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Well, who is your lord?
The same!
All right!  What do you want?
Of course.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
I move for no man.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Stop that.
Come Here.
I'm invincible!
Are you sure he's got one?
Now what happens?
They're nervous, sire.
What with?
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Too late.
Je...sus Christ!
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I feel fine.
I think I'll go for a walk.
What is your name?
What is your quest?
That's easy!
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Don't be such a baby.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Well taken, Concorde!
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Herbert.
If we ... er ... 
Right.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Hurry!
Stop saying the word!
They're all saying the word ...
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
I speak as I find, Archie.
How much?
Sixty.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
What's this?
Be careful who sees it.
You should have someone look after you.
The place is a mess.
What's your name?
Checked and locked, sir.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
Convey her a message.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Gesture?
By whose authority?
No.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Do you hunt?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
She'll never understand it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Well, both.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Read it.
Why not?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What do they want?
What do you mean?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
How the hell did you do that?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
What's her problem?
Hello?
Can you turn off the game?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Change the channel!
The Police, then...
Then where do we go?!
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Virgin sacrifices?
You got the schematics?
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
You don't get it, do you?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
What the fuck is that?!
Which way?
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Someone's shut off my money!
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
It will work out.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Yes...what is it?
So, what did they say?
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Was anyone hurt?
Number 17.
I think I've been hurt.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay... but just...just to see.
"You're still here?"
"Really?"
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
No, we don't.
Yes, Sir.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Not here...no thanks.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No.  I haven't seen any.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
What about Matt ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
How do we get out of this room ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
You took an awful big risk back there.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I... I .....
You okay ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Where are we going ?
Do you know where you're going ?
What about you ?
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Is it over ?
Where ?
When I think you're ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
What's wrong ?
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Excuse me, sir ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Zachary.
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
How long till the drug wears off ?
What is Bruce doing ?
What's next ?
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
What the ... ?
The power went out in half the park.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Are you okay ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Not now, Mom.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
This is California, anything is possible.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
No nuns, got it.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hi honey.
Thanks.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Sure am, who are you?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Hi.
What are you staring at?
Hi.
Then what did she do?
Is it okay if I drink this?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
But we made a business deal.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Come and get it.
Where are you going???
You mean,  this ring?
Never heard of her.
Right.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
No?
Wow!
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
I mean...with your car.
Excuse me?
Good morning.
Something wrong?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
He's so tiny.
Arthur!!
You're such a baby.
Danny?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
The boss is watching us...
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
I ahh, better go.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
VADA!
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Why?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Please.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Why?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Shut your big fat mouth!
He won't give it to me.
Hi.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Sure.
Are you going out somewhere?
No.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
NO!
Goodnight.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
At what?
No, I'm going home.
It's a mosquito bite.
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
What's wrong with your eyes?
Hey look at this!
Hmmmm, interesting.
Do you remember her?
Heaven.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Come on, let's go.
Get up!?
Why are you running away?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Like this?
Close your eyes.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Zit cream?
Two words.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
But I can't be dry.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
And loving him means loving all of this.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
And the answer was so simple.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
But he always says...
So... one almost has to...
I never want to go through this again.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You're not eating.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
I'm up against a deadline.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Michael? What ha...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I asked you...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
The Big Hurt, huh?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You got the money?
I hate that music.
You're from out of town?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Barbara Jean.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Okay.
Bastard
He's my father.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
He is just wonderful.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
You in music?
Wrecks.
Parts.
What kind?
What year?
Mom?
I don't think so.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Doesn't it have a name?
How old are you?
Thirty?
Premeditated murder.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
I can do benefits
I mean...
Probably a little too long.
Hi.
Why?
You go to school together?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
You want a ride into town?
Got me an audition tonight.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
You think it will?
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
You got something you want to do?
Mickey!
Looked like an interview to me.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You've heard of it?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
You guys stay on your bellies.
Manson beat you.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Sorry about that.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Tell me about the purity.
Describe Mallory.
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Just wait one fucking minute.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Hypnotizing.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
And where do you keep Mickey?
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
They done that too long in my family.
Boy - you hear me?!
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
You a union man?
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Yeah.
Walker and Williams.
She done moved to Detroit.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
And his age?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Yes, aren't you?
My father's the preacher.
That's right.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
How about another beer?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Get out of here!
What d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Goin' to see my kid.
What about that girl?
I can see why.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Hi.
No point fixin' it!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Okay.
They all got families to support.
'You Will Anderson?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
How you doin', boy?
Want me to hold the light for you?
Well, what're you going to do?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
So I been told.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Well, I got married to one of them.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
We got any shots?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Take this off.
What the hell is that?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Tell me the words.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
What are you talkin' about?
It'll flatline your ass.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
What is it?
That's not going to help.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
It sounds like you.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Case... Are you alright?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
My God... these people are insane.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
What's that?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
YOU DID.
No Roger from op/ed?
Forget it.
Bridgework?
Cuuuute!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
George! What are you doing here?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Hey there.
You having fun?
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Are mom and dad here?
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
That is so sad --
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
Are you having fun?
He <u>has</u> to know...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
I'll kill you now.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
It's gone now.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You want to talk about it?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
So, school going alright?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Morning.
We're going up to bed now.
I'm serious.
I'm sure you would.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Girl, what are you doing?
Horseshit.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Tell me about the kids.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's what I know.
That's right.
Then maybe you're ready.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
I've heard crazier things this week.
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Oh Jesus.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Thank you.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Okay -- fine.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Floppy, huh?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Why?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
You've got big feet.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Oh please sod off.
Hi.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Yes...
Excuse me.
Can I have your autograph?
That's right.
Where are you going?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Hello, Bernie.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Yes.  What do you think?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Ahm... room service.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Mr. Thacker?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Cappuccino as ordered.
That's right -- Topol.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Buggered?
Well?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Oh God no.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, sir.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Try 'Flintstone.'
I wouldn't go outside.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Bad news.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Why?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Yes, Billy?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
That's it! We made it!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Mister McMurphy.
I hope everything is settled.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
So long, kid.
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
What for?
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Mine, too!
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
You can come back later!
Gimme a cigarette!
Hear what?
Who told you that?
'Kay, place your bets.
Hit me!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna see it...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Oh, what's that?
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
How do ya know that?
A dime.
No!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
What are they?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Yeah...
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Hi.
Yeah!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
There they are!
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Is everything all right?
And you haven't heard the last of this!
What?
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Is he in an asylum?
She was your sister.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
No, really.  What's she doing?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
You're sure...
Good.
We found each other, didn't we?
Who's dying?
I'm a liberal!
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
You...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Smoking or non-smoking?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
That's not the point.
How could you do this to me?
You're limping.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Why not?
Why?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Hey--
Nice dress.
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
Yes.  I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Been here long?
Sure.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Well, to-- new friends.
Excuse me?
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
You don't have any idea?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
It's a miracle.
I have vacation time coming to me.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
So?
Ah ha!...
A Butterfinger wrapper.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
You think he misses me at all?
What did you say to her?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Who said I was going?
Whatareyoudoing?!
And he is living proof.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
What about Larry?
And you are?...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
A porco?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
She what?!
I have to talk to her.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Father Barry.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I'd better go in.
What for?
The Golden Warriors.
Now what are you doing?
What made you want to be a fighter?
What are you going to do?
Edie... Edie... ..
I've been sittin' in the church.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Thanks just the same.
My pigeons... .
Where you goin'?
I don't get it!
But you've got to listen to me.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
...walk?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Really?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Give me a double.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
No advice. Just whiskey.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
I know, Johnny, I know... .
—Do you?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
What do you mean?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
She was?
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I would have time for my own pleasures!
You better hope there is.
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
He wants us.
What do you suppose for?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Oh, is this Adele?
Lie face down on the floor.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
You didn't visit him in prison.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
I don't know where he is.
It's Richard Ripley.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Nice disguise.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
I'm going back inside.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Sure, Daniel.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Who?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
How many was that?
We still talk, though.
Is that right?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
How'd you get this number?
That's my dad.
Think I could have them back?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You were going to see her?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
You busted out?
There were others.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
What's going on, Glenn?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
How's it going?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
I really gotta go.
What are you thinking about?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Out for the evening?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Thank you...
What?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
...the fuck is this...
Are you sure they're here?
Nervous?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Land of the free...
Didn't you say test the limits?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Then why are you looking for her?
Waitress!  Four beers!
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
What's there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Yeah.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
So beautiful!
I heard what you did.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Win?
How often you fight like this?
You take care, Dorie.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Danny's not coming?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
It must of been a convincing letter.
What if the Japanese did invade?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
Fook ya!
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
Let's go.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Carol!
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
We're here on the sofa bed...
But you love me don't you?
You got a Tab?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Want me to drive you home later?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
Charlie, let's make love.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
I'm sorry Charlie.
Charlie. About last nights..
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
But what has to be different?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Just take a look at it. 
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Terry, slow down.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
The hat business is in trouble.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
How did it go with the pantyhose?
I'm excused.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Sort of.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Sort of.
Okay. I promise.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
What're you doing?
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Hi, Richard.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
I hear you moved into town.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
I think so.
What are you talking about?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Is this a good spot?
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
Allright. Calm down.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
We're not skipping this treatment.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Whatever.
Thanks, Charles.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Congratulations.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Nine.
Find a lawyer?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
What?
I've considered that.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Except... you were gay?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
No. I can't really see it.
Hello?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Were you recently promoted?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Great.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
How many gays do you know?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Don't know, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Right.
Now that you mention it...
Julius!
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Tell me that was you.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
They're already dead. Get on board.
You'd die for them?
What do my eyes see?
There....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
What, switch what?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Little ratty-ass.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
Just shut up, okay?
We cannot go through there....
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
Frightening thought.
Imam. Slow down.
What're you doin'?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
...then we saw this.
King Tut's tomb....
What the hell are these?
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Well, what's it look like now?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Take it.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
Where does the river lead?
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
The blood transfusion.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
You didn't think so then.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
What happened?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
I want her.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
No.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Tell him to pull back!
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
You! ... You knew about this?
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
You want her that much?
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
But the proof? The doll?
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
Sarge?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Come on you can do better than that!
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Feel good?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
What you got there - beers?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
What we got here a crusader?
I didn't like it.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
It might be worth a Martini to you.
And do you amuse the guests?
You're drinking it.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Want to dance?
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
They're going to arrest me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
If you're doing all this just for me.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Please answer my question.
What this?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
FLorida?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
What'll you have, Margo?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Where?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You'd be breaking the law.
Mitchell was too drunk.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
What do you want?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Got a moment, Inspector?
What do I get for it?
Right.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
It does.  May I go now? 
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
So-so.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
What's this?
I told you she's just..
Right.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Thank you.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Congratulations.  Who with?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
I'll have some of that.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Oh yes?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Damn.  They're early.
Why not stay?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't seen much of you.
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
To the airlift.
The torture of small children--
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
What period?
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
What would you call it?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It was last year.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
Don't point it at James!
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Friends of yours, huh?
What's their program?
You gonna pull?
You're a fucking dead man--
Why should I?
Three seconds... two... one...
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Johnny, it's the only way.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
The hell are they?!
I know where they're going.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
What's goin' on?
You had enough?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
What have you got in mind, General.
Georgia.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What's your name?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
You're joking.
No, but it's getting there.
Better believe it.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Try a strawberry.
Did you sleep well?
No?  Why's that?
I buy companies.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
I'm not just talking about sex.
This isn't a date.
And that's the way the game is played.
You're upset, huh?
You liked the guy, though.
You always been rich?
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
Real genuine guy.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fuck off.
What if I lose it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I've never been on a plane before.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Business.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
What's up, where you going?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Who did you think?
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
It was great.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Want a pair of boots?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
Miss Vivian --
May I help you?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
He will come for me.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
He knows I do not love him.
... as ... you ... wish...
I fear I'll never see you again.
But how can you be sure?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never survive.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Why is that, do you think?
I only dog paddle.
Faster!
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Probably he means no harm.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
-- all that I have and more please --
Sixty-five.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Slow going?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Because I know something you don't know.
Who are you?!
Kill me quickly.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You're that smart?
I accept.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Here, don't panic.
What was I saying?
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
What kind now, Leo?
Maybe you're happy.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
To failure!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I never should have listened to you.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
But he has long hair!
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Get car.  Get car.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Of Siegfried...
People can hear you.
Okay.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Let's all talk about Mary.
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Did he say anything about my sister?
What's the matter?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
I was getting to that!
What thing?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
It's been three.
I feel better when you feel better.
He didn't come back here?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What?
We could laze around here a while longer.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You have something most girls never have.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
I'm looking for a private island.
Why do you ask that?
You should... mind it.
That's it. 
Norman took a wife?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
You didn't find anything.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
You here again?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
That spoke to you?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Yes, why?
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
We'll be coming to the opening.
Let me go! Let me go!
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Which one is me? The horse?
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
That's what I said.
No kiddin'.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Oh, is that what caused it?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
But I have some friends waiting.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
She is the soul of that statue.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Could we go somewhere?
Could you?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Of what?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Dysfunctional --
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
I got an awful toothache.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
There goes Mother.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Wow! Brrrother!
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Is her husband sick or something?
That's what she would say herself.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
How goes it, darlin'?
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Quarter of twelve.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She hasn't actually done anything...
It's twenty after one.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Is anything wrong?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Is this ill right?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I got an awful bad cold.
Well, it was a silly question.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Yes, I am.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Galley what?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
I see. Outside it.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
How much?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Who cares?
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
No offices are gonna be open today.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
What's the plan?
The booze.
What day is it?
Where we going?
Gimmie a butt.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
Hey...
Smooth move, hot-shot.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
I can't believe we're stealing.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He tried to kill us.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ?  Not you too?
You get him?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Been waiting long?
How'd we do?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
What the hell's his problem?
We're screwed.
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
I don't think so.
The gang's all here!
This shit was Ming.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Yes, my Master.
I have felt him, my Master.
Han!
The same as always.
You got her warmed?
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
What are you telling them?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
What's he saying?
The Emperor has been expecting you.
If that is your destiny.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He might be.  I don't know.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Oh Brad.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Hello.
You're OK by me.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
"Transylvania"
On the day I went away.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
I just dislocated my finger.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...Guess.
Would ya like a glass of water?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
It's okay.
Like?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
...Can't do it.
No... I can't!
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
My side.
No doctor!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
How was the flight, Champ?
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
...That's an old one.
This a con?
That's ten bucks.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
I say ya nothin'!
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Yo' yellow, old man.
A hundred an' thirty.
Ya still light seventy.
Ya sure?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Excuse me.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
The legs must be goin'.
Did ya win?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Here's the card?
Whatta' those?
...What?
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Wanna keep goin'?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Hey --
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
What kinda business?
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
What's ya sister like to do?
It don't bother me none.
I got whiskey here.
Ya really like her?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
To see ya train.
Do you feel you have a chance?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
What's this, Roger?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Is this paper even good?
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
They must've taken it off me.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
You?
Does it hurt?
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
So where is it?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
What the hell is that?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Does this help?
How do you know that?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Keep reading...
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
I'll not endure him.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Goodnight.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
I will follow you.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Of course.
I don't know.
Well I don't!
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
What in bloody hell is going on?
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Hazard pay...
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
I'm a patriate.
Are you alright?
We'll double your price.
He's company.
Here's yours.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
And more importantly --
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
So what do we do?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
So this is what, a test?
So what is it you want to know?
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
You should watch what you eat.
I ride with fat-boy...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
He trusts you to lock up?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
I'm going with you.
Alright, it's done.
The Irish representative?
You sure your friend got the right place?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
In a minute.
Time to quit.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
You speak French.
Gaelic.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Can you get it?
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
What the hell happened here?
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
It's the right thing to do.
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Well what are we supposed to do?
Here it is.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Dwayne's dead.
It's too late...
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Hi.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Why does that bother you?
Sally, do you love me?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I guess we can get started.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Hello.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
C?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
It was going to be a surprise!
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
I'll settle for a third of that.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Hi ma.
Did they ever find out who they were?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I got my sources.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Carter, get off that stage!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I'm sorry.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
It's my job!
Not Yu.  You!
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
No, no, that would be crazy --
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Let me see it again?
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
I'm not used to having a partner.
I think we should stop talking.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Vegas...
We made it, man.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
You move well.
Are you okay?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
What is your name?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shut up!
Good job.
Feds asked for me?
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
You speak English!
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
What?
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Want some?
Excuse me?
What?!
Which one?
No, please, I don't --
Oh no, I dropped it.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
How about a lift home?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What kind of assignment is that?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
What?!
Yes.
Hello.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Ahh.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
And in a "V".
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Maggie!
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
In vino veritas.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
You're going to be very disappointed.
That's fair.
Everest.  Is that right?
Really?
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Give me that!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Five hundred.
Maybe someday.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Kind of isolated.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Lost!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
You were not.
You're a goddess!
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
But it's on the water.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Even when you were young?
Happy New Year, darling.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Who is it?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
About forever.
Walter.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
You should write something about this.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
I love you, too.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
But he saw you, right?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
You're going to miss the train.
What are your plans in New York?
I love the symphony.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
You know.
Sure you do.
Who is this?
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Why not?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
What was it that made you know?
Why not?
No.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want a fruit plate?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
No, I'm not, but --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
When I found you?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Are you sick, Mama?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
To the mine?
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
A fighter, huh?
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Let them take it!
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Ramón -- you can't.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
Yeah.
What?
It's not that easy.
I can't leave.
What do you want from me, Colette?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
I need my paycheck.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Why not?
Really, I don't want to.
What is it?
Colette, go.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
What time is it?
Where to?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
You're going to have to explain that one.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Can we talk price?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
I'm sorry?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Shoot him.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
You got a name?
Thanks for not judging me.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
You've got no choice.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Murder.  Beautiful.
I thought you'd be happy.
Please ... don't do this ...
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
You mean like the Donner Party?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Report.
Casualties?
Sir?
But, sir...I...I...
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Good luck, John.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Jackson?
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Not yet.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Upham?
Some.
Over three-hundred.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What about our grenades?
What'd you say, Captain?
Captain, what about our deal?
What about the company?
You get a translator, Captain?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
Uh, Captain...
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
I don't think so, Captain.
Trust me, you're the best.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Yes, sir.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Shit, sir.
I usually like surprises.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
What's the profile?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'll take the whole set.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
So, what's your point?
No, you're not a guy.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Why?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
You like it?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Morning honey.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Honey, about what?
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
That's right, work it out.
Hello.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Nobody knew me before tonight.
You know what?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
So what's your job this summer?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
No.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I think that we should spend some time apart.
It sounded like you did.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
YEAH!
Jim Court?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
No, really.
I know.
My car.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Oh, I was just going to...
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man.
Well, let's find him.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
This is not my problem.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How you feeling, all right?
What's wrong with it?
Thank you.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
It kind of looks that way.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
I was just the accountant.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Don't ever do that to me again.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go, I'll see you.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Four hundred, four fifty -
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
Have you checked the...
I heard a noise.
Outside.
Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
I thought you were going to the mixer?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
He seemed harmless.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
We had to have financing.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Not good. How you doin?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Who is this?
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
I have rehearsal.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
She's not here right now.
You ass.
What are you talking about?
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What?!
Where are you?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Oh yeah, how?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Detective Kincaid?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Yeah?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
They found another note?
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
What's your point?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
You're dead!
Yeah?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Owwww...
How'd you do?
Duh... that's quick.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Ready?
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
You rode your bike out there?
Billy? What the...
What are you doing here?
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I wanna let go. I do...
Hello.
Popcorn.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Yes?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I wanna play a game.
Then he dies. Right now.
What kind of game?
No... please.
I don't know...
Michael... Michael Myers.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
And why is that? Has something happened?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
What brings you out to these parts?
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
She staying with you?
Where is she?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Off the record. No cameras.
Where do you get this shit?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
I heard screaming.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
For about two seconds.
Jesus, this place is packed.
You coming tonight?
She's saving herself for you.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Yeah.
Why are they doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Or a man's mentality.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Take a message.
Come on, Sid.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
No way.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
What do you think?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
What?  What?
What time is it?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
A woman...
You should be thanking me.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I... I don't follow.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Not here.
Who said this was murder?
This doesn't make any sense.
It could be nothing.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
No fingerprints?
No witnesses of any kind?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
What?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
I wish I still thought like you.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
Does this make it with you?
And?
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
How do you know all about this?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
Well... what the fuck, man?
No.
Slut.
Tell me it's not true.
Are you absolutely certain?
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
But Mose Harper said...
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Let's get along...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Got a warrant?
I didn't give any order to fire!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Well, the reward still stands...
Told ya, didn't I?
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
I beg your pardon?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
You want us to fire a shot if...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
And you think we got a chance to find her?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Hey! What's the idea...?
Futterman?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Think she means for us to follow?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Was your niece about their age?
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
I have to cut his windpipe...
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Where are you going?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Who's that?
Maybe an animal.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
How did you get me out of there?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Ellen.
I really hate to bother him, but...
No, I've never seen him before.
Ellen Straub.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
What?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Hammer?
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Ned…I know…I know
Ah
Follow that boat!
Wait!  Will you desist!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Are you writing?
So now you are free to love
When?
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
There's never any
by order of the Master of the Revels!
But nothing is happening.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
No Juliet?!
Do you know it?
God be praised!  Locked?
Who is she this time?!
Where are you going?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
Another little problem.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
As a nurse.
Your mother, and your father
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
What do you love so much?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
My lady!
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh my lady, my love!
And that was only my first try.
You would not leave me?
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And break her heart and mine?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
"Poet?"
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
I was trying to educate you.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
You mean immoral.
You think so?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I can't do it.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
What is this?
What? Yes, that's fine.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
They know.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Well?
Don't know what?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
Well, is it?
That's it, then.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
And you like it?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
What?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
I thought you stopped going.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
The man we know and love.
Hugo.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
I wonder how he did it?
What are you doing?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
Hello. Hello.
You know we're right.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Later. But first -- him.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Aren't you going to answer it?
I refuse.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
What?
Of course.
I see.
Is this what they always look like?
Are you all right?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
What?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
What do we do here, David?
In this firm.
But they sneer, don't they?
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
For what?
The human condition.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Same as everyone else.
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Sorry?
You can tell by the intonation.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Don't you like her?
Do you think George is a fairy?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- is that what this is all about?
You're late, George.
I don't want to talk about it...
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
-- to be put in that kind of position...
George --
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
Is she all right?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I know.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Oh, no.
You going to answer it?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
You know what I'm talking about.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Did you hear me?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Well, are you?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
No shit.
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
What sort of references do you have?
You promised you'd do the show.
You're late, George.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
Where do you want to do this?
You don't seem very sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
And?
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
-- what guy?
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
-- ass and legs --
Me?
What's wrong?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
I've got to leave?
-- It's Malone's.
Well then what are you trying to do-
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I don't know... Jackie?
God, there's Lester...
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
What with?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- yes, George.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
You're great.
Maybe you don't even like children.
George?
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
A friend dropped me off.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I know, honey.
What does he direct besides traffic?
Television or movies?
Now, Jackie --
I've got to get her out of here.
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
How come you took your own car?
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
... well I'm glad you told me.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
You live like a pig.
Why, why do you think that is?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Me!
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
You really think so?
Awww --
No you won't.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Of course not.
Shut the door, shut the door!
I'd like a drink.
Here.
Who are they?
Does she know about us?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
-- you phony asshole --
Hi, Leonard.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I am? I mean why?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
You're really a love -- you sure?
What?
He does?
But why Egypt?
I'm terribly sorry.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
-- what's the problem, honey?
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
You seem disappointed.
No!
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Are you having a good time?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Dad?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
No I ain't.
Yeah.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Jack...
Yeah.
It's so pretty.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Shall we go into the living room?
Tony.
She eh... interferes.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
What'll it be?
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Sure is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Jack!
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!
Stop it!
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Have any trouble finding us?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Only in a very general way.
Right there.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Thanks.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Went shopping. Why?
Are you all right, Marty?
I've been hearing noises in there.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Really.
You know, I just might!
Okay, Christy -- strip.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
You bastard!
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Oh, girls.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Babies
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
Come on, we're late.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
You have to help me
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
The reason?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Yeah?
I got it.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
It never solves anything.
Really catching on.
So... hi there.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
A vote?
But... wait a minute...
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Ten flights?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
I just need a few more weeks,
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I have?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Hey, girls.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Then one day they find you.
Vince -- is she... okay?
And if she runs?
Get her!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
What's she doing?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Is this like your old convent?
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Where?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
They spend two days in chains.
You must have missed your mark.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
You need to sleep.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
I manage fine alone.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Are you familiar with magnets?
No, I couldn't...
Thank you.
I hear nothing.
We are leaving.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
What was she doing?
What books?
What now?  Where is she?
What can we do?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
You promised justice.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
What are you doing?
What is so urgent?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Quickly, close it.
Use caution.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Yeah.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
I want to watch T.V.
You like that Vaughan?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Don't hit that boy no more.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
They let you out?
How come?
Are you well?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
How did your mama die?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
What do you mean?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Why not? It died?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
It was fun, anyhow.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye boy.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
Yeah.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
What brings you back?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
I didn't mean that.
Yes.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Like me, too.
Will that be cash or charge?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
A photographer ...
They're all the same.
Slow down, huh?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Hey, man, how's it going?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
So. Are we ready?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
And you're giving it to me?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Seventeen.
It'll never be finished.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
You going to sit here all day?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Here and there. Around.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Celebrate? What for?
No wonder he was angry.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Fries?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
I don't know.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Now, Mister Gi...
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
How long you have this detail?
You mean, early morning the 16th?
You said three minutes.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Well, why does it?
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
We don't let go, you s...
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
What makes you think I play?
You wouldn't even see it move.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Can I say something, here?
Are you absol...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Okay. 
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
We're not?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
My name is Josephine.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Good night, Daphne.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
What message?  What motorboat?
With ME?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Not that, you idiot.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
She sings, too.
We'll take a rain check.
Oh - Sugar!
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Anything wrong?
And you've got cold feet.
I'm a very sick girl.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
What do you think you're doing?
His yacht?
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
No!
How did you get that bracelet?
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
About that roadhouse -
Another bridesmaid?
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
We can have it altered.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Anything today?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Bingo?
Really?
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Yeah.
Why not?
Want to switch berths with me?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
I'm not interested at all.
- opening of the Opera -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Shell Oil?
Guess!
One of whom?
Been waiting long?
I seem to be out of gas.
Oh - in here.
What is it?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Look at all that silverware.
You mean - like frigid?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Anything this time?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
We got different information.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
And who runs it?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Huh?
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
You heading to the train station?
What’s his problem?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Hey.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, Kat.
Hey, you!
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
That was a long time ago.
You’re not even listening.
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Mission accomplished.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Six thousand, right?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
How did you know that was me?
Would you grab my shampoo?
There’s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
It’s hard to explain.
Is this for last night?
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
You pawned it.
What do you say to that?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Go on...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
No buts, Rita!
Yes, sir...
David Lee...
You learnin' anything at that school?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Mornin', son...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Where did it come from, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
Can't sleep?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's that you carryin'?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Hello, David...
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Whatcha wanta order?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
But, Nathan--
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Fuckin' a right.
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Cartman?!
CARTMAN!
Mph rm rmph!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
What was that word, young man!?
Donkey raping shit eater.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph rmph rm!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
That's gonna take a long time!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Oh, brother.
Oh dear God...
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
I am the dark master!
We must take action on this immediately.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Who's my cream puff?
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Check.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
I think we're moving.
Oh yeah...
Evening.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
All too well, captain.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Why, didn't they say?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
You gotta think of your old age.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
We're going to die.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Really?
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I can't let you do that.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Dawn!  Dawn!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Dawn.  Come in.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
What the hell are you doing?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
In that case, I accept.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
How is it looking, Mac?
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You know, Elvis bowled.
- canker sore.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Think he bought it?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
This scam we got going here was your 
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Where'd you get this ball?
Theo.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
What about bowling?
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Don't tell me, John.
I don't like to talk about it.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Leave him alone!
He's not here.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Uh...over easy.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
This is a vicious cycle.
Where did your brother escape from?
What does he do?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
He's dead Sheila.
Where are you going?
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You're really pissing me off.
Fuck plan C!
Very professional.
Some unfinished business.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Fletcher, get away from there...
There's heat coming the door.
Hold on --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Norman!
Thirty yards.
Where is it?
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Can you open that panel?
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
How much damage?
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
So?  What's the problem?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
A half a mile long?
Did you hear me, sir, because --
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Norman.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
In Edmunds' things.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
It's not worth the risk.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You fixed my suit?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Still clear?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Page 87.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Looks like some sort of code.
Riordan?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
What is it, Norman?
Did you?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
You manifested that, Beth.
I never went in that sphere.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Then where's it coming from?
What is that?  What are you doing?
How's that?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Where's it coming from?
Is it coming from our own computer?
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
I don't follow you.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Norman, where are you?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Her legs are in the way.
How's that working out, by the way?
There is one possibility.
What does Norman already know?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
How are the others?
You've heard of me?
You want me to try?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Was it a military crash?
How much do you think she's talking about?
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
I'll get the information.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Who are you anyway?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Are you all right?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Who's the pilot?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Get to the ship!
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Are you safe?
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Mobile Infantery rules !
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Did you read her mind ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
I'm all ears.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Well, whad'ya know...
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
So ?
How do you feel about him now ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He's nothing like you.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
You're late.
Shhhh...!
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
What's wrong with you ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Where'd it come from ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
What's that, Diz ?
C'mon...
Oh, my, what's that ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Best in the Fleet !
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What is your position ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
<U>Why</U>...?!
<U>Why</U>?!
Disclose the information.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Forward motion, Captain...!
Hello, Ilia.
One hundred kilometers...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Go you Huskies?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Well, it had sentimental value.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
That: in an act of...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
Me?
Hello.
You like kids?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
It's for your finger.
Hi.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
What've you got?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
How's your star?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
...and we could get up every morning...
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
Ten thousand dollars.
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
Hi!
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
I'm sorry.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Big day last night.
What courthouse?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Waterford, Vermont.
I will.
Fourteen year old girls.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Bobby, don't say anything.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
What do you drink?
How old are you?
Nice town that you've got here.
Are you all right...?
What else?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
You do...?
I'm very sorry to...
Aren't you ever in school?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Nobody.
You have no right to...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
You have to hide.
Will you help me out...?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
Claire, when did you...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Wally...
...yes...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
You show Claire these sketches?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
What?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
I have to talk to you.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I'm looking for the writer.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
He saw the accident...?
Not now.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
You can't write it?
You didn't see it...
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What is that...?
My oh my.
You cool the broad out?
How was your flight?
Marty...
Pay her off.
<u>Find</u> it.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I want them thrown in jail.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
Mass hysteria.
Like who?
I'm gonna call him.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Scream.
How would you know sh...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.

We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...

He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
What's Thursd...

He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What if he's kidnapped?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
No.  I think it's ugly.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
Uh.  What is it?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
Excuse me --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
I'm fine, ba...
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Where Ben?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Rachel's not half my age.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
It's temporary.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
Yeh?
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
...in.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
You WHAT?
Look, you've never liked me...
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Small world.
Oh, my God.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Looks nice enough to m...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Thanks for coming out.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's forever you know.
What a great surpri...
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Hey.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
No prob. I'm cool.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But still, you can't be sure.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
What's an audience going to tell you?
Twinkeys!
Mom?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
I can read it to you.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
Reconceive.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
The same. Same as what?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
You're not.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Ni...
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Huh. Kids?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
You a pervert?
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Cooper...
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Are the labs in operation?
Go fuck yourself...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
So, what are we looking at White?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
How goes the roll call?
Where the hell could they have gone!
Drop the anchor!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
What's the meaning of this?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
I guess so.
Where, sir?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
To peace on earth, Major.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
Then there's no chance for recall?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Can't "Ace" help you?
Where'd they get you?
What do you mean?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Maybe the warning system's out.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Forget it.
Sure, King.
Um-hm.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
In Group?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Slides go with it.
Uh-huh.
Hey!
Yup.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Sounds like a bummer.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Good.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait. Hey, man.
What?
Tim...
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Really?
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Oh, you were in the band?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
It's okay.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Yeah, we're all above that.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
You rich?
He is.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Erica.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Oh, wow.
Um, mother-daughter.
Uh-huh.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Tim, what are you talking about?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Well, w-what happened?
Yes.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
No.
Jeff! Come up here!
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Of course I do!
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Um, because you didn't want to go.
This is ridiculous!
Okay, what would you have done.
What?
No, I don't.
Mm-hm.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
You did, huh? Good for you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Now?
Great.
So who are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Hey, where's Erica?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Get off my roof!
Pony, oh my god!
Oh!
So? What's L.A. like?
You do not!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
You're not serious.
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Tim?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
So where are you?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Could you give me a ride?
Fuck.
I'm in, too.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Another sex dream?
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Hi, Jack.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
I know, but that was before.
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
I'm sorry.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Shut up.
Kansas!
Oh no...
Yeah?
Hello?
Yeah?
Ammo?
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
What the hell do you want?
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Give me your coat.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I didn't.
Well....
With a wildly beating heart.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
So do I.
Oh, you --
Good.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
What happened?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
We've made a lot of pictures together.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What's that?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
They've come for my car.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
When did he say it, Norma?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
How did it go?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I made your bed this afternoon.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
You made her a star?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
How's that about your being my friend?
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Paramount is calling.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
A Storm Dragon?
Why did she have to show up now?
Home?
I don't feel like it right now.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Is this Nigel's doing?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We can't do that.
Let me kiss you.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
She said it wouldn't last.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Before you go...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Finished your estimate?
I bet they do.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Guess! Go on.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Hey, where you going?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Can I give you a lift?
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
Superman will return it.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
She did that deliberately.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Who are you ?
What is this place?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
But it's impossible.
You're going to take me back?
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
He really was!
Well, aren't you excited?
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
What kind?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
When?
What?
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Is this whitemail?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Can you do that?
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
What about you?
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
I don't know you, lady.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
85,000 dollars.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Yes! This time we got it right!
Anybody been hurt?
Lois, I usually do.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I don't?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
I'll try to remember that . . .
Everything on it?
Genius!  --  Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
He flies as well, then . . .
You must be freezing.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
What more?
Free!
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
I think there's an angle.
What's he going to say?
Where's Clark?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
He's . . . cold. . .
Boy, are you gonna get it.
You think he'll find us.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Do you know where you're headed?
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Are there any more at home like you?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Hey!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Can I take you to the airport?
Super...man. Hmmm...
What are you doing here?
This??
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Again???
Krypton!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Then -
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
I guess I got carried away
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, the kickback story...
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
How much do you weigh?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
I...uh...
What's the matter, Otis?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
What is this??!
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Luthor  --
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes.
Ally Jones.
Then...when did she get better?
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Good night, Billy.
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
From what?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
Excuse me?
Anything you didn't understand?
That's what he said, is it?
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
How was it?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
That's right.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
Why?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Do you have a room?
What about Doreen?
Need a hand?
News?
That's not news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
You are?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
I was scared.
What's that?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Will you mind your own business!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
But of course...
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Sidney, I told you -
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Talk to her, Sidney...
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Could this be that boy?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Back?
That's the third time he's called today.
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
You're talking very fast.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
We stick in each others craw.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Please... let... the kids... go...
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Drive for a minute.
Will it melt in there?
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you.  I always will.
You broke my arm!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I'm very sorry.
Where you from, David?
So what is it?
What's that mean?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Tough, tough!
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
How?
What did Goering say?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Von der Null?
I'm sorry.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?
Yes, you remember.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
What?
And ask him about his private life.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
So, you never heard of him.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
What do you think?
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
There's so much...
You cold?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
What's that?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
A girl.  You know.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
Sarah.
Surrounded by living tissue.
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Here's her driver's license.
Send a unit.
Same shit.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
What?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
Clean out your locker.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Do you know what to do?
This can't be real...
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
I'm sorry, about this...
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Please...
There's a ladder here.
There goes a thousand dollars.
That one did.
That's classic.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Take the picture out.
They're watching.
What are you doing... ?
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
What did you say?
I don't know.  A lot.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I have to get to the airport...
Julliard, yeah.
You need anything?
Really?
Trust me.  Call that number.
Tell me you'll call.
Tell me where we're going.
What have they been doing to you?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
How do you know?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
I'll explain someday.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
It's different every time.
We provide whatever's lacking.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
You don't need me...
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Dinner's in the oven.
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Hey... !
What's happened...
Nicholas...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Are you working with her?
Eleanor, how was the drive?
Nell!  What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
Welcome Home.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
That's where she hanged herself.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
What do you do?
No.
How could he have left without his keys?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Not for you, clearly.
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
How they goin', kid?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
What kind?
You should have let me do the talking.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
What more is there.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Didn't get it.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Weren't you on a television series?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Disappointed.
Modelling.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What's that, like a P.O. box.
What line is he in.
Right.
Are you serious.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Of the deal, man.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Hey.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
How'd you get in here.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Is he here?
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Hello, Rachel.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
...she can go up there.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Oh, Jesus.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Your place?
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...What a knucklehead.
Dave.
Honey.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
Should I... should I tell you why?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
Will anyone else say they knew?
...I don't get it.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
...Huh?
That was quite something.
Jesus...
This hair.
...You ever wonder about it?
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
...I'm Crane.
His eyes are open.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Behind you.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
What's that doing here?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
What's that?
Something tried to get into this room!
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Where is that?
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
You work here?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Oh no.  I smell it.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
What?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
How did you know that?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Genetic damage?
Wounded?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
Hide quickly!
Help someone!
You smell that?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
The creator of what?
I have a map.
No.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Arrah!
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
--we need more charcoal.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Good.  Good.
What am I doing here?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
What is it you find incredible?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Who called this meeting?
Do they know?
Have you examined them?
And what's that?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
That would be my guess.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Now what?
Where are you, Mulder?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
What? What are you talking about?
You're... quitting?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Why are you whispering?
How was it contracted?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
What are my choices?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
This virus -- it... 
Scully....?
Where'd they go?
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Scully...
Scully --
Cold...
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Sing a song of sixpence...
Did we go sailing?
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
What then?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
With Stargher I saw things...
You think you can do this, don't you?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
That went well.
Who says?
Agent Cole.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
What about the legalities of this...?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Agent Novak.
How is she?
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
You sure you want to go through with this?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Ich weiss nicht.
Den leuten.
Thank you.
No.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
His own doctor?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Why?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
When...what did you do?
...and buried him.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Holly.
I wish I knew.
...again.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You can help us.
Must you take those?
What is it?
You a friend of Lime's?
Been here long?
See much of him before that?
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
...expense.
A parrot bit me.
Do you see what that means?
So would I.
Calloway!
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hello, Harry.
Listen...
I want to talk to you.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...the best way one can, you know.
Dr. Winkel?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Already gone.
Baron Kurtz.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Third Man.
Where are you staying?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Everyone ok?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Oh, please...
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Too difficult?
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Are they still together?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
The sex is better.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
I didn't realize you cared.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
An investment banking house.
You wouldn't announce it?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How have things been going?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Tell it to Hitler.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Hello...?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Shut up. Fuck you....
Not too fast.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
Leary?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I tell you she's mine!
You know each other?
This is a great pleasure.
Where did you two meet?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
And just where are you from?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Well, good night, then...
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
How do you know that?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Yes?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
It isn't lit yet.
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
You're the best, Enzo!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
Well, what are they?
Enzo?
Madame...
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
He doesn't like us.
Anybody can have a bad day!
That's good.
A drink to warm up?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Then, tell me a story.
Why?
Assassin!
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
In my apartment?
... And the new stereo.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Wait!  Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Any sign of Santa?
What!?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Mordechai?
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Hammer, you alright?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What day is it?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Then what do you do?
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
The death card - -
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
What, senorita?
Show business?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
It was you.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference. Get him out!
You're too good to me.
On his back, I suppose.
Who was the other man?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
And she waited here for him?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
That might depend on where you’re going.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Can it be that easy?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Is there anything to understand?
Something like that?
To get me killed...?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Then find another way.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Piss off!
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Am I supposed to know him?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
It’s about the puppy. You got the money?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Evening. Table for one?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
Is she on the phone?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
What about which girlfriend?
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Try again, and this time be polite.
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
Mossad?
Costliest!
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Jeanne, stop it!
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
To be killed in battle?
We must sound the retreat!
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
Jeanne's alive!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
And?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No, I... I held it up to...
W-w-what are you doing?!
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Who are you?
Trial?  What trial??
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Were you baptized?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Please... may I have it back...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
Supposing she's an assassin?
... as always, majesty...
Does he have hair?
5,000 gold crowns.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Clear?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Prepare these as battering-rams!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Who gave you that horse?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why were you yelling like that?!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
No.  That was a sword in a field.
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Are you going to leave me too?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Oh yes... very.
Beautiful.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Who are you?
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I need help.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
When's your baby due?
Let me see this.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
For what? For my tie?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Have you seen this?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Can you help us?
I've no money.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Boys, boys...
It's not funny.
What are you reading?
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Out of Warsaw.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
What's happening?
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No, it was a table.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
What for?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You have to wash them.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What?
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Yeh, go ahead.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Twist, you know this guy?
How much did ya lose?
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
I'm out, Johnny.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Henry.
You beat him, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
What's the problem?
You in?
How ya doin'?
See and raise five.
I guess I left it in my room.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Looks like he missed ya.
Hooker!
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
So could Shaw.
Get on with it then.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Will you wait until the chump is played?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
What's your next step, Nick?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Any luck?
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Oh!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
How did you ever remember me?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
There. 
She... she fell over backwards.
Don't lie to me.
Dead?
He'll still be your son-in-law!
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
How's your brother?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
That woman!
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
No proof?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What about this Nunheim?
He's holding out on you.
Trail him!  Trail who?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Are you kidding?
Shut up.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
But he's interested!
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
I don't like him.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I can't! I haven't got it!
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
My wife.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Where's Gilbert?
But he has nothing to do with it!
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
I've never heard about you.
Why tell me?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
What hit me?
Good. I want to talk to you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
But it's Christmas now.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Aren't you hot in that?
Why don't you?
He's just been for a walk.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Wynant's body?
How long has he been dead?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Why are you saying it?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Nick Charles here?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Paper.
A casual one.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
They shouldn't have been here.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
There's nothing we can do.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
So you can give us away?
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
What!?  What!?
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Take the binoculars.
You can't tell anybody about this.
It'd make their heads explode.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
SAY IT!
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
What!?
What?
It's a mine, isn't it?
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
How's this going to work?
You're going to be fine.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
Don't!
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
A whole lot of nothing.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
Why do I have to stay down here?
I don't see how that plan's any better.
How!?
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
First Wes, now you?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Getting cold.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
What did you say?
Oh, God...
Slip out your M-16.
Can you ride a horse?
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
What does that mean?
What is this?
You get it yet?
Jaeger?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
I think he wants something to drink.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
You know I don't feel well.
I don't know.
Then why did you bring it up?
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What time is it?
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
They're watching us now.
Good Lord!
There goes another of your disciples.
What?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
What's going on?
I'll report you.  It's....
I'm leaving.
...and you're not lost now?
How do you know?
She's not there
No...no you're wrong.
Just look at all those people.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
May I help you?
Hey, that's the guy-
Who the heck're you?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What're you talking about?
What was-? Why...?
Now wait just a fucking-
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Why do you do it?
Which one's which?
It's working.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Yeah, another round thing.
What... ?
Right.
Whadaya mean?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Any word?
Bev, you're the greatest...
Glass, what is it?
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
What is that?
What's the matter?
No... No more killing.
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
He is!
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Next week we work the park.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
A what?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
<u>Niente!</u>
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
And as for you, waiter--
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Who?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Right.
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
But, Lily--
And you--
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Yes.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
The same thing.
Madame.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Precisely.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Then why do you want to go?
Thirty-three--
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
About what?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
I think you'd better go.
Your bag?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
What?
The partners want to know how it's going?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You told me to change.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
This should be amusing.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You're a good liar.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Hello again.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
And...?
I don't know the steps.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You jump, I jump, right?
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I'm sorry.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Could I see you a minute?
I thought you were one of my friends.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Where have you been hiding?
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Tell me.
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
What are you thinking?
Don't let's talk about it.
What, again?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Nix, the law!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
A dollar forty.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Thank you, sir. 
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
You keep it-- 
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
I'm going to the show--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Hello, young fellow!
Don't get yourself all worked up--
That's too bad.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Here you are, sir. 
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Oh, there you are--
McKinney's the name.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
How much did you lose?
He's all right.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
I'll explain later--
Ain't got time.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
He said to turn loose of him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
You don't even know him.
Not exactly...
Since when is faro a business?
Very instructive
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
He's drunk.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
I have to go.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Oh, all right.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Really?  You sure?
Mattie.  What about this?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
Get down, boy.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
That a fact?
We should get moving.
Look pretty rough.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Briefly.
I'm sure they will.
- Instant melt-down.
I'd rather die alone.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
What - no lust for adventure?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Don't you think you're overreacting?
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Do you feel better now?
Paris -
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
That's reassuring.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
They point, I shoot.
... Kids?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
If I were you -
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
This has got to be a mistake.
What the hell does that do?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Sleep well?
... Yes?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
What do you make of all this?
... And what do you call these?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
No.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
How sweet.
Is the helicopter ready?
Oh, no.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Will it go off?
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
What did your wife get her?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You're always taking his side.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
I'm worn out.
What did you put on it?
Man, act like this is your home.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
How is everybody?
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Did you have your child at home?
What must I do?
What are you doing?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Yeah!
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
What are you doing over there?
Hello-o-o...
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
I could have stopped him.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Come on, this way!
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Ha-ha!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
No she's NOT --
That ain't no happy child.
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Bad news?!
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
You'll put your clothes here.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Everything is gone, now.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
So my wife is lying?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
Is this bad for him?
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What if every country legalized at the same time?
I don't know.
...How old are you?
What are you doing?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do you think it is?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
David --
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
What's he doing up here?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What is the name of your informant?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
Does this offer include my partner?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Who are these guys?
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Twenty thousand.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
What's your name?
Where's that?
Jesus.
Holding hands?
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
You take the test?
That's nice.
Good luck, Spud.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
You Only Live Twice?
Who wrote it?
The park?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Did he -- you know?
You know.
God, you're sick.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
The Sick Boy method.
That's hardly a substitute.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
It's the great outdoors.
How's it going with Gail?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
We go for a walk.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Homeless people?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Can we have it quiet?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
No, but you can bet they will.
Where did you get this power?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Captain?
Life is not a dream.
Not General Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
To land any closer would risk detection.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Spock.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
How do you know?
I am here, Captain.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Spock.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
No special conditions?
What have I done?


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Each man's pain is unique.
Spock?
Sybok, we must find a way...
Are you embezzling?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Of what?
Beautiful!
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Oh. Anything else?
Cute.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
That was uncalled-for.
Well I want to communicate --
Well, isn't it -- ?
What's that?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
What is it?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
You bitch.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
That's not true, honey--
You seem fine now.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
What's the plan?
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Any minute now.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
He's got it.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Yes.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Uh huh.  Okay.
They said you had to run out.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Why did you continue to see him?
Not because you were attracted to him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
What?
Natasha?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
Is it working yet?
17 years.
I don't take those assignments.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
You working on someone right now?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Boris and Doris?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
You can trust me completely.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
And you chased one?
You'll call me then?
Who is this woman?
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Did you get the letter?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
The forager's back.
I didn't get any chicken.
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Burt Reynolds.
Like it?
What are your turn-ons?
Do you get paid a lot?
God, Spiderman looks different.
You mean she got a bad batch?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Is he black?
Is he nice?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
I do.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Write down Drexl's address.
I think what you did was...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Wannabee nigger...
Clarence?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
What?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
You're really in love, aren't you?
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case of what?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
Do you really mean it?
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
What?
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Don't you?
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
What makes you think I could do that?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Keep it.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I don't believe you.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was very good.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Nicholson and I.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
You do more than try.
He knows.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
You gotta hold this for me.
No.
We want you to tell us about last night.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Germs?!
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
You have him in restraints.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
What?  What did you say?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
You want somethin'?
You own this place?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
How much time?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
How much?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No!
Please, just leave the car alone.
What you want?
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
They look nice.
What's the matter?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Wasn't nothing.
That a fact?
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
What do you do anyway?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
My face tell you all that?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Is it pretty?
Jake.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
Let's go in the bedroom.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
What?
I shot him.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
No.  I swear it.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Where you headed?
Live there?
Hey!
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
What should I do?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Jake--
It's the truth, Jake.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
What are you babbling about?
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Now, what's this?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
The old lady?
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
Say, what happened to your hand?
California...
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
I need thirteen.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Will he be back soon?
But he's dead.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
So?
Accident.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Hundred-fifty.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
Thank you, Bobby.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Did you ever?
I don't know how.
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
I busted my leg!
What'd you say to me!
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Heineken?
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
I axed you a question.
I want to stay.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Proceed.
Once again please?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Oh shit...
Megan?
I remember you.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
What about the game?
I assumed because of the train.
Just give me a minute.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I have to go now.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's kind of a miracle.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Yeah?
When?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How many did you put on that time?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
I'll just shoot him once.
Don't be scared.
Twelve years.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
He tell you where them others is?
He give 'em names?
Scouting?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Yeah. See?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Mmmm pistols.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
The... Duck of Death.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
What'd Ned say?
Then... what?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
He said that, huh?
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Did you kill him?
Shit!
That was... the first one.
Wha... what f-for?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
She gave me the evil eye.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
He's gonna die, ain't he?
That ain't what I mean.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Yeah.
Who ?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
I know who he is.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Me too.
How do you do?
You have to come.
How are they going to do it?
Three million?
What-are they speaking?
What if I
with what?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
You set up the line-up.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You got him wrong.
What call?
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
... tell me about this case.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
We went to Code Blue...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Ed Concannon.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
I do.  Yes.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I am on the staff of...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
Thank you ...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I need an extension for my case.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I can't guarantee that...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Is this a bad time.
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Well, then what are you doing here?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What are you going to do?
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Admittance form is wrong.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Been a long time, huh...?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Another, Frank . . . ?
Well, well, well.  Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
He won't talk.
How long have you been back?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Would you like a drink now?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Yes.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
About three years.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
No? Then what?
You want me to dress like her?
Come here.
That's what I had in mind.
Scottie!
We're going awfully far.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
We're going up the tower.
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
One shouldn't live alone.
I hope we will, too.
I don't know.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Why?
Would you like a drink of water?
Where?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
Where?
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Let me go! Let me go!!
You believe that I love you?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
My... the acrophobia.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Out!
What I've been doing?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Can't do what?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
You're an asshole Adam.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Don't point at me.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Go home!
More.
Wait!
What are you doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Real times.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
If anything ever happens to me...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Have you thought about what I said?
My god.
So. When is the wedding.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Who?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
He's right.
He's too drunk.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Nobody knows she's here.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Boyd...What have we done?
What?
What?
Regarding what?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't hate women.
False.
Not true.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Stop.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
How late?
This is our honeymoon.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Who's dead?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Everything okay?
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
I don't care for him.
I'll take a ride.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
There.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
"You Send Me."
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Good times.
Shut up Micheal.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Are there many windows?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Was that difficult to get?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Yes, it is.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Let me pass!
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
You believe me, don't you?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
It's very good.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
So, Ramona!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
You see how much you like her?
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Miss Viridiana ...
Well... is it so urgent?
And ...your friend?
Is she coming back?
Are your parents alive?
You cannot leave ...
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
Ask the priest, miss.
What happened to me?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
What did you find out?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
How does he know who I am?
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
How should I know?
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
A little less than yesterday.
John died.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Don't get out of the car.
What did you do to those people?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
My guess is dead.
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...mmm?
Izzat the thing...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
...where?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
<u>Do</u> it...
What would do that...?
...the... 
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
We'll be back tonight.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
...this is magnificent.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
...brazen-it-through...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Oh, Lord....
War's over, Pal. 
How's your wife?
Courage, Mom.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
...Yes.
How much...?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
What?
...we get our hands on him?
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
You can't tell this story.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
Show Must Go On.
What're you doing?
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
It's tough to rhyme.
What would be true, then.
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
Just want to take a nap.
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
a "pond," or
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
... That's what you told us to say.
...if I had your looks, better.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
What's going on?
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
What brings you out here...
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
...thanks Natalie.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
So what's the problem?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
How do you know?
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Know the name?
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
What the hell do you want?
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello Bud.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
What if I have a previous engagement?
So. See you Friday.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Would you like a closer look?
Your books Master Loftmore
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Stop saying things so loud!
That was very good.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
What?
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Why is he worried?
These are good.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Are you humoring me?
Your friend saw them.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
No.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
When...when will she be back?
Who are you?
I've seen you.  From the window.
Tell me.  Please.
That's not...It's not like that.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
I wanted to apologize.
Your house is so beautiful.
Mrs. Frank?
No, I don't.
What's your name?
What was her major?
He looked like one of the Monkees.
I didn't sleep with him.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good.  So you're human.
It's niiice.
You think he killed her?
Know what I think?
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Oh...
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Adamant?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I'm a terrible friend.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
How are you?
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Maybe we should just...
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Claire?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
"...for my father."
Did you tell her?
Sorry.  You understand.
Our house.
What are you doing?
Are you lonely?
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
I'm sorry...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
...I'm positive this time...
I take it your not mad at me.
Your wife...
"You know..."
Stop...
The leaves...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
There are two.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
A what...?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Who is this...?
My...mother...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I don't want the -
What is it...?
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
uh - then he - be just -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
STOP!
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
If that were true, I would not be here.
I know that you're evil.
No!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Harder...
What else did you see- Michael...?
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Why don't you let at do that...?
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Hello...?
You know...?
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Do you love me, Michael...?
You sure...?
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Wanna snack...?
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
You did that, didn't you...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
When aid you get home last night...?
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Hi.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
On which planet...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Which do you think is her best shot...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I heard something like that
When could I look round?
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
This must be one of the old keys -
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Tell me how it happened...
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What?
What's wrong?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Why did you let him in?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
Dead?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Who the hell was your father?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Well?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
You're way ahead of me again?
You guys are my parents.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
My legacy.
James, what are you doing here?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
My new bike.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
In what sense?
Funny you should say "peachy."
Wow...you clean up nice.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I see.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You promise you'll finish school?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You called the cops on us?
You do like girls, don't you?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You were the new and improved you.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
You look pretty.
How soon can we get something?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
That bothers you?
Yeah.
No.
Yes.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
Ms. Toller?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Okay, what's the matter?
What?
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
We have to stick with the plan.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I'm here.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Say you love me.
I'm running away.
But check this...
Good thinking.
Forget it.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Come on, let loose!
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
You mean this thing?
Jesus, man... You okay?
Sam...
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
But don't pull that again.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
What was all that back there?
Jim, are you all right?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
So... what happened?
This is good.
No record of him.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
Are those just button buttons or...?
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Good work.  Really.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
You're not that big.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
Hey...!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
You are very important, Willow.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
They look like acorns.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I do what I'm told.
Why did you say that?
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
What's that?  I hear something!
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You!!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Kill him!
You must learn magic.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
Time is running out.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
Hey, Sam...
Are they going to kill you?
Amish.
You know who?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
You have no right to keep us here.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
But why would they murder...
How long?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Where's the nearest telephone?
But Stoltzfus said...
You know carpentry?
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I was being foolish?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Anybody know about this?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
You hear me?
You admit you're lying?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
John said you're Amish.
Good morning.
God, Fred...
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Get back in there.
Is this where we're going?
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Ahh!  Ah!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Oh, now?
Oh --
That's our farm!
Oh --
...bed.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh --
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Oh, my!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Does it work?
They're coming back!
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oil can what?
The other side....
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Yes, you.
That's right.
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Where -- where do we go now?
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Whozat?
Where do we go now?
You don't get around us that easy!
Mr. Gale!
No, her dog!
...of the West.
To Oz?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Yeah --
Stop that dog!
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
What the hell are you talking about?
What is it?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
...yes?...
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Your last chance. Take the money.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
No!  It will cave in!
I can’t stay.
Then take me with you.
I don’t want to be safe!
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
Was this all about the oil?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
The Maiden’s Tower.
No! Bond!
I’ll send someone out.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
A whore fucking.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
The bearer of bad news.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
What -- am I --
No.  I just wanted you to --
Who?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Old?
. . . What?
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
What the hell -- ?
They're practically on us . . .
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
New information.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Why is that?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Thanks.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Are you alright?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Where's he headed?
You okay?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
What are you doing?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
That's the guy.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
That was for Anders.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Scott.. I -
What are you talking about?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
I'll tell you one thing though.
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
He's uptight.
He takes himself seriously.
I do love a good check mate.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Where am I?
He helped you?
Don't you knock?
What did she do to me?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Is that so?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Carlson!
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Surprised?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
I hope you like large weddings.
Darling!
Darling!?!
What a strange fellow.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
I didn't do that.
One week at the most!?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Are you putting me on?
I see.
There.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Did you hear that strange music??
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
You can't win 'em all.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Original.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Yes, Master!
Come on, big fellow!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
How's everything?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
What's that tune that you're playing
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Inga, wake up!
Reputation.  Reputation!
Oh, Doctor!
Do you think you can sing it?
Give him the sedative!
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I will.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
His what??
I'm getting tired.
How do you know they're done?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
