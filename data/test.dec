Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
You always been this selfish?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
I did.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
It's just you.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, no!
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Just sent 'em through.
How many people go here?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
She's partial to Joey, not me
How much?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Just a little.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
Does it matter?
Who cares?
I didn't have a choice.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
I know, just let me sleep
You know what they say
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
For. . . ?
Hearsay.
Why not?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
What?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Because you're making decisions for me.
Parts of it.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Yeah...
So Dorsey can get the girl?
We're your guys.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
With the teeth of your zipper?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I don't want you to wait for me.
You don't usually ask.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- he has a God.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
My horse doesn't work.
Six days ago, yes.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
What about Oleg?
What else do you need?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Divorced.
Somewhere else?
So you were never a prostitute?
I know.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
Daphne, I...
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Stay with her.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Did you tell him you did?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
You're Polish?
I'm on duty.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Then do it, asshole.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
There are two bodies found at this point.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Answer the phone.
That's good.
I'm not moody.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Yes.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
We have no money.  Come on.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Sit down!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Did you hurt her?
Ha. Ha.
A job?
You want the tape?  There it is!
I want to hear everything he said.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
He's my collar!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Clean?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Yeah?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Okay, come on down.
It's possible.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
No.
Yes.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
And don't you worry about it.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
How many days until you come home?
Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
How is gregor?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Yes, very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Thank you very much, Hal.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Here's hoping, baby...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
So do you...been a long day.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
When? How?
What's wrong with that?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You sure you want me to?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
So what?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
That's no bull.
What do you want?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
This ain't a credit business.
Napoleon... small.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
You noticed...
Good luck..
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
When is she not in trouble?
That's what I'm saying.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Perfect.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Have you pulled yourself together?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
He's on vacation.
Just one... why me?
Cornelius..
What is... Make Love?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
OK, you can turn around!
...The rain falls...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Been here long?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Wonderful!
How much time is left?
Options.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
I love you.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
There's nothing harder.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
I'll consider it.
Machine.
We can do that.
I'm camera shy.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why?
Tell me what happened.
What did you do with her body?
Show me.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Easy enough for you.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Never mind how I found you.
Enlighten me.
I'll risk it.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Good for you.
There's not much illegal.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Interesting theory.
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
Specialty product.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
See ya.
It's their Presidential Suite.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I told you I can't, not yet.
Okay, I follow you so far...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
No.
It got to be too much for him.
Of course.
We're all like that.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
It's okay, we're just about there.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Earth to Alice...
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Been having bad dreams.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Sobering...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Krueger is reality.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
But I've seen her grave.
Yeah...
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
I can't listen to this.
He invited me to his house last night.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Listen!  Hear that?
Somewhere down there?
What????
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
What direction does the system indicate?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
After torpedo room:  Report!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Same old shit.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
You played for the Sox?
Oh.
Yeah.
Shit.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
It's stupid.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Nothing.
Okay.
I know.
I want to go home.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Maybe.
Could be.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
For a while.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
Said what?
Yeah. I mean that.
Jack doesn't need money.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Think they're alright?
Wade.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Can --?
How's that?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
He got his deer yet?
Bang!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Yeah, I guess.
What about her?
That it wasn't an accident.
Not particularly.
Yeah.
Well, I never heard that one.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice... I...
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
He's busy being dead.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Dead.
Stand by.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
No.
You'll do it?
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
What?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Flying the plane.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
I just wish it was that simple.
Yes I did...
Sir?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
That's right -- premature ejection.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Maybe.
Yes, sir.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Sure.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
A b...
Yes.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Then Elaine was right.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No. I'm all alone.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
He had fish.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Yes?
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Yes, Captain?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm Randy.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
No. No thank you.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Why'd I do what?
Uh, Matthew...
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
My wife?  She worries about me.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Fuck procedure.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
No... two.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Sure.  Just a minute.
The human?
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Departmental policy.
It is. 
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
See you soon.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Hear me out...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Bullshit!
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
They're but off!  Do something!
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Aye-firmative.
Fuckin' A!
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Hudson, give us a break.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Just get back here!
No.. I've slept enough.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
You're really something, ace.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Did you ever have a baby?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Don't bother.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Sir -
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
What?
Don't be stupid.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
I can't write it!
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Gertrude!
Who was your teacher?
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Well. There it is.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Yes, indeed.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
What is it?
Ah! By all means.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
He's here.
I will.
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
Bene.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Yes what?
I don't know. He has pains.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Can I see it?
But this is absurd!
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
How could it not, Excellency?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Who are you?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Come. Let's begin.
Please! Just one moment.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Also identical?
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
You go fast!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Exactly.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is what?
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
In the sight of God that is a sin.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Ah - you've heard that?
You cannot say that!
Yes.
About the ballet.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, in the third act.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Yes, Doctor.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
The zoo? Is he rational?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
I dream of death mostly.
I know.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you think about it?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I was awake and he was in my room.
What?
Chart says he's from New York.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
So they said.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
She's a jerk.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Wrong.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Do you think it's a dog?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
What do you think?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Hello.
How shall I do it?
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Yes - sure—
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Matt?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
What are you doing here?
Hello, darling.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Happy now?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
You're protecting somebody.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Don't you think I know it?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
I tell you, I saw them!
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Yes, why?
He was here?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, sir.
wasn't anywhere near this place—
I don't know.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Oh no...
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What?
I could use the walk.
Sure, cousin.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
I got us through the War all right.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
I'm out.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
I'm thinking...
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
I figure.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Maybe, maybe...
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Heard of him.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
Bob's upset.
If I could go back to farming --
Got any ideas, little brother?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
You didn't want to farm?
Sparkling rocks?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You been with a girl ever?
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
What is going on here, man?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Oh, that's the best part.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
Stop it. I'm...
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Everybody's rich.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Yes, I am.
I'm just leaving.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
No.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Yes, naturally.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
New card. What do you think?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
Just...say...no.
Patrick?
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Why?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
What do you think I do?
Hello 
Next Saturday?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Why would I?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
It's no problem
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
We were both seven in 1969.
Oh.
No.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
People just...disappear.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
That's not the information I've received.
I checked it out. It's clean.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry.
What am I gonna do?
Oh well, you know.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Yes, Owen?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
'Gonna wait outside.
"Make" him?
Didn't you visit the campus?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Guilt?
...Different?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
You're just afraid to eat it.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Yes sir.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What'd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Would you like a Coke or something?
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Okay. I'm Gary.
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
You're making me young again.
Oh. Yeah.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
The wrong place?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
You do?
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
...Something like that. Yeah.
You're compulsive.
Why's that?
Then and now.  But not right now.
She saved my life.
The Day Care?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Certainly not at my happy home.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
What'd he say?
Gary.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
That's lame, isn't it?
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
It's three years old, it --
What?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Uh. Not exactly.
What does that mean?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Groovy.
Sak-i it to me!
Oh, and Austin...
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
We won, Austin.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Thank you, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Thanks.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Here, use mine.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
How do you know?
I couldn't have another bite.
I am not.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Not now, Austin.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Not me.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Scott, don't say that...
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Well, it's kind of weird.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
... bottle ...
... head ...
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Then who wins?
Hmmm ...
Ropes?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Next assignment?
You killed my husband.
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
What are my choices?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Whereas you are.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Do you really think so?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
As per mother's instructions.
I meant me.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Very good, Steed ...
Is that written in his shoe?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Orders.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Where are you going?
What kept you?
Have you any place in mind?
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Surveillance? By whom?
Who's now vanished.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
... and now?
Global warming?
We want Mrs. Peel.
How did you guess?
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Where?
She was ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Bond... James Bond.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
She's mine!
Fan out and look for them.
Yes I did.
Sure have...
Keep me informed.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
1002.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
But a fabulous cook.
Are you going to have women at your party?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
C'mere.
Good...
Gonna get married...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Your mother's not dead.
You're so romantic...
I hope those guys are all right.
Let's see your bread.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What are you...
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Ha, ha, ha.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
You can tell a man by his friends.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Olivier's in that, right?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'm saved. Let's party!
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Be gentle.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Just come down, John. Just --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Who asked you?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It works.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- Never mind.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Thanks for the insight.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I know.
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Got anything to drink in there?
Then why did you quit?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Yes.
Just take it.
I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have a story.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
What are you listening to?
And the putty around the door?
Are you going public with this?
Fire.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
How ya feeling?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
No need to be modest, Brian.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
I was ahead of my time.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
I'm busy.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
He's out.
What's wrong?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
He works for me.
Absolutely.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Just catch the son of a bitch.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Why?
Who?
Yes.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
How about 7 1/2?
Are you sure?
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Yes, Sister?
How 'bout...
Did he gots to be.
YEAH!
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Please.
Delacroix.
Meaning?
Damn skippy.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Well do something about it.
How you sound?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
I'm wid it.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Exactly!
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Calm down, please.
Pleased to meet you.
Is that so?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
Hello.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
A gift.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Light?
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
You sound like the media.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Yeah.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Not at all?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
The best defense is offense.
Thank you.  And always smile.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
Oh her.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
You slept too near where you got in?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A song a comin' I feel.
No, before my time.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
And what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Say what, Manray?
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
That is none of your business.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
It must have been some other gate.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
As you please.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Have you not a man whom you value?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
As much as possible.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
The milkmaid's daughter?
And he doesn't care about me?
Who?
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
HEY!
Shut up, Mueller.
We don't know. West is dead.
It's... too slow.
I just don't like it.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
He's lying.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Jesus!
And the bodies?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Why?
I...
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
That's exactly what he says about you.
You're lying --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
What don't you know?
I didn't kill him --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
I don't know --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
Well, he's a good soldier.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
The Senator...
What are you talking about?
You're drunk --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You're crazy --
You knew Sergeant West?
That is the most unprofessional --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
I lied. Wait for it...
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Good, just making sure.
Isn't this how your story goes?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Really.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
You can't threaten me --
Wait --
Wrong answer --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
The fuck are you talking about --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
We know.
Yes!
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
Thank you.
Edward Bloom.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
No.
Was she nekkid?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Lucky girl.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Make him stop.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Did you do any of that?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
What did he say?
Can we talk?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
'Fraid so.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Probably tonight.
That's because most of it never happened.
You're not.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Yes?
No I don't.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
No I haven't.
Ch...
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
You're asking for my documents?
John.
Yes.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
So you're just going to be vindictive
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
It's none of your business.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Get out
Thank Christ for that.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
What was her name?
Cash.
You take her to a doctor?
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You liked what I brung ya?
At church?
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
She's around. Always is.
You been home yet?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Rose... please...
Come on, gal...
Well I don't...
Don't need none.
Why you got me chained?
Uh-uh.
You drink whiskey?
We drinkin' buddies now?
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Naw!
Or what?
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Not like that.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
I do.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
That's right.
You feelin' sick?
Are you wasted?
You need money again?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
What?
No.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I wasn't expecting you.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Kampai.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
Me too.
Luck.
He gets as much as he wants.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You met her.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Why would you care?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Right.
Look.
I have to get to Sugai.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Also extraordinary things.
Nexus - 6.
Dr. Tyrell?
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Thank you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Your customer, eh?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
And what in your estimation works?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Prosit.
Four years.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
No.  I got a problem.
Meaning?
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Of course.
What's suck night?
Sorry.
And who do I go to about you?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Ugh.
You did?
Dead.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
What?
I never felt better.
What's a long time?
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Don't move.
What desert?
Of course.
Pris.
What's that?
You like it?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
For how long?
Young man, stop right there!
Oh, brother...
Do ya?
Are you French?
Oh, that's nice.
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Take it. damn it!
I haven't brushed yet.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
They like Dr. Pepper.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
A wife?
The big one!
Sure.
That's what I was afraid of.
Is this your house?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Sure.
Uh...yeah.
That's boring!
Okay!
Well...yeah. Okay.
Not that one!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
But, Eve, I would--
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
No.
Yes, Eve?
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Yes, sir.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No. Sit down.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
You nut!
And it's called...?
Really?  Since when?
Juneau.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Almost all of them.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
How old do I look?
Just look!!
Sorry, Mom!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
You bet, hon!
I never know anymore.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
What?
Honey?
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Coming!
And I made these!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Well, that's blunt!
I think...it...works.
No.
We did not leave together.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Give it back to him.
We'll find him.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Then what?
Come on.
Where?!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
You did? A human ear?
Yes?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
No, not at all.
Only you and the photo lab.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Then you got undressed.
Never before this.
What?
Yeah, hurry up though.
I, uh.
Don? Are you in with them?
I sure don't hate you.
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Yes.
Do you love me?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
If you want to.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Hey Jeff.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Aye.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
What?  What, that guy?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
BLAME...
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Our mother can see through bags.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
For what?
A bit.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
How do you figure?
Rocco!
What about one guy with two guns?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
No way they could have seen it?
What?
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I'll be back at 9:00.
Hey Murph.
You believe?
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
Yeah boss?
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Would they do that?
She's an attractive older woman.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Eight dollars.
Hang on a second.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Bob?
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No. We didn't.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Shh.
Don't panic, Anthony.
How much?
She needed it.
I know that. But --
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Right now.
He seems pretty good.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
He was all right.
Take your second position.
It's going back down.
Careful. Check his pulse.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
I don't think so.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure.
What do you mean?
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Hold it.
Yes, he did.
I don't want to die.
Yeah.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Move.
You think I'm improving?
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Temporarily.
Dies y nueve.
Like silk?
Abdul-Shabazz?
The front stairs.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Not even for emergencies?
That never would of --
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Maybe she turned.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
I'm going back.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Anthony. Bad news.
Yeah. It is.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Yeah?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Where's Applejack?
What's that?
He said what?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
No, my friend knows her.
Mr. Henry?
It's locked.
Save it for Bourne.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
...this is Conklin's computer.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
No good options left?
Keep going...
Okay... 
YOU'RE A LIAR!
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I don't know who that is.
I did.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I worry when you get like this.
The Telegraph office.
We can't wait to be sure.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- not yet --
But you found another choice.
You do?
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
What is this, a game?
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
No. You never worked Berlin.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Bourne?
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
What's that?
And the Germans can't match it?
What? The tapes?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Me? Four years.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
By who?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Are we hacking or asking?
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
So let the council swear publicly.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
I have ordered conscriptions...
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
No. One of us is enough.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
A common thief.
We don't split up!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I... accept your proposal!
You scare me.
...Tonight!
It's battle I want, not talk.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
Exactly.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Can't he come out for one day?
Great. I'll see you soon.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
No, protecting her.
I see a car.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
What?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
It was a long time ago.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
You'll see.
What do you mean?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Why's that?
Different? How?
Yeah?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
Huh?
I thought I was the bad guy!
Oh my God oh my God...
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, sir.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
And the carrying charges?
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Good day.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I will.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
You can believe that if you want to.
Richard, I had to see you.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
No, not yet.
Yes, ma'am.
Apparently he has the letters.
He suggested I ask you.
I love you very much, my dear.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Thank you.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Here it is.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Very well.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
-- Thank you.
Yes.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
But I have no excuse to close it.
What, again?
Our entertainment is enough.
Perhaps not.
Victor Laszlo?
-- Thanks. I will.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
You think of everything, don't you?
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Take your hands off me!
What is your nationality?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Yeah?
Not right now.
No.
Good. Then have a drink.
Then don't have a drink.
No, I don't.
Worse than Warsaw.
Take it, damn it.
I'm putting it off.
No!
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
They're harder to do than they look.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Well, not really, I --
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
Had a package to deliver.
You smell like formaldehyde.
You don't seem too happy about it.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
You want to.
I know.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Great.  Really.
You too.
And how was your Christmas?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
I most definitely say I am.
No.
Let's eat.
Don't you even think about it.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Deep, real deep.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
You cook very well!
I doubt it. She's just an...
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Sure... I'll see you around.
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
"King Kong". It's really good.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
He's *paralyzed*!
Please don't...
Yes, I *have*!
I never said they were boring.
I know what you've been doing.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She looks after other people's children.
His father's dead, right?
A B-24 Liberator.
Really! Is it serious?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Migrants?
Okay...
I guess so...
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Obviously.
You do it then.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I'm happy I amuse you.
Of course.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
And you have this letter of intent?
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
After you cut her loose.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I told you, use less powder.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
Well, this is just fucking great...
Tonight. Just me.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She's up for it.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I have a good crew.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I need you to stake me.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I think I just broke my hand.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Help me.
We're not cops.
You interested in a little work?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
What?
Lighten up.
It's what I do. It's my job.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Don't ruin this for me.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
What do you want? An apology?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
What do we need another Shill for?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Good point.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
With identification.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Keep it up.
It's not history.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
To who?
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Goodnight.
I can imagine.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
I don't know anything about it.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
How about five hundred.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
You mean I won't resist them.
I. sold the car.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't know.
Fine.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Probably.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What about a drink on the way home?
It's the truth.
You will?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Your father?
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Robbery's not criminal?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Thanks.
Nice car.
How long have you worked at the casino?
You're talking about complicity.
Good call. Help yourself.
I put them on together.
Jack.
Five.
How?
Right, that checks out here.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
I read the same here.
Energy shielding positive function.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Armed.
Huh?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Which one?
Fred.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Ah... pity, pity...
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Yeah.
No?
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.
Leave.  Now.
You mean until you showed up?
Police drone.
No time.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
I don't want to move away.
Girl's gotta make a living.
First time I ever heard that.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
The one you're wearing?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
You lost me.
You did go through my stuff.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
How well do you remember the lab?
Somebody's got to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Look, thank you for this but--
I'll wait.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Then what?
Got a pencil?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And because he's my friend.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Pull the cash.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
What if he's on the level?
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
How'd you get her out of town?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I'll give it my best shot.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Theo's dead.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Right, slow...
What? That's disgusting!
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Damn straight we are.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Oh, yeah...?
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Hawk?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
The KISS Army!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Not until like... eighth grade.
I didn't say shit.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Hey...
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
I'm sorry.
Will you go with me?
I'm going home.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
And you'd never been there before?
Are you okay?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Where is she?
It's safe here.
Where are we going?
The Lifeline is divided that way.
That is a terrible nickname.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Why should we care?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
How so?
I met a girl.
Four times... so far.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
But you were punished.
You've done it again?
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Why?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Her name is Gretchen.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
That's enough.
What else?
Kitty...
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
I stole four beers from my dad.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh-yah.
Okay.
This came for you, sweetie.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
What?!
We was robbed.
We all do. Now let's go.
You heard me. Where is it?
Bitch!
Yes, Leslie!
Loretta, shut it.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
They told me to practice.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
The king can do to wrong! 
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
The President of the United States.
"My dear"...
"My"...
"My dear President"...
Is that all?
I'll have to enclose the check first.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't want him.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Sure.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
And Vera niece, too.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You worm!
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I've always thought that myself.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
No, I think a whiskey.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And here are my mother and father.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
He fell.  He falls.
You don't own this man!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Oh no, my friend...
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes John!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Mmmerrick."
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
You did not ask me.
Yes.
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Oh yes.
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
I thought as much.
Yes.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes! The workhouse!
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Yes. John wants it.
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Who?
But, Erik...
Goodbye, Aud...
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
I... but I...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No... no...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
It is day, of course, Freya.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
That I cannot tell you.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
You're just saying that.
REALLY?
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Yes?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Shut up.
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
You DON'T like it, do you?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I don't know! I just did!
But...
Come on, move it!
It saved my father!
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
Don't you FEEL it?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
But you're the Gods!
Like fish.
To the oars!
No! Arrgh!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
I was sitting there.
DEATH!
Bye... sorry...
You will wait?
Please.
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
He hasn't.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I... I...
What have you got there?
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I know, Dad.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Helpless...
Easy, Dad!
Me too.
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mother.
I never do...
No one.
You did? You liked me?
Hi.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm not nuts.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Well, anyway... Sorry.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Yeah?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Sort of, um...
What?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I'm fine.
No, I'm okay for now.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
No, not at all.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
No. Thanks.
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I love it!
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I remember that speech really well.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I'm Joel.
Seems too coincidental that way.
What are you doing?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I think we should go.
I love you.
I don't know.
Hey, Joel --
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I just walked in.
I guess so.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Long day thinking.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Well... I did.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
You have to stop this!
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Hi.
'kay.
We haven't checked.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Then why did you ask me?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
It was a mutual decision.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
That's fine, Stan.
Easy come, easy go.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I don't.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Yep.
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
On my way.
No, thank you.
No, he didn't.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
He's crashing...
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
Starck!
How do you know all this?
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Justin.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
There's no one here, Skipper.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
Do it.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
That is not acceptable --
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Better if I just show you.
You're lying...!
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Something like that, yeah.
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Where is it?
Love to.
Starck, give me a read.
Captain, we got a problem.
What is it, Smith?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Come around to three-three-four...
Do it. Dr. Weir...
What is it, Starck?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Yes.
They're explosive charges.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
1000 meters...
How?
Do they have pressure?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
It's easy for you to be patient.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Should?
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Well maybe you should date him.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Last one down springs for room service.
Ben! Ben!
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Girl...?!
And if he's not...?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
It's been changed.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
You were?
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Not at all.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Hilarious.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Raising the shields.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
It's the first door on your left!
First door on your left!
Manager!!
Sis.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
They were left over from the last shift.
Let's continue.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
We've got to get an abortion?
No.
Really?
All right. Pay attention.
Chicken!
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
And they don't call my parents?
Then don't hassle it.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
He was hot, wasn't he?
No way! He just called him a dick.
I know.
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Climax together.
No.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
What class?
Really?
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Aloha, Spicoli.
No problem.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Oh... yes.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Not at all.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
Awake? What do you mean?
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Naked.
WHAT?
Dobermans don't talk.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Hell, no!
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Jesus! Did I say that?
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You whore!
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
How about a check?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Plans?
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Lucy is looking for you.
It's gone too far.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Yes!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Never missed a plane yet.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
No! I swear I'm not!
Part of what?
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
But it's got teeth.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We're lucky to be alive.
Where's that?
There's a tunnel.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Shit!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
What?
Yep.
We lived near power lines.
What's in the back?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
But --
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He only shot you once.
He shot you the other time.
What?
Fully.
Two.
Covered.
Get outta here.
Oh? And what's that?
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
Gimme the keys.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
BONSAI!
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
That's fine.
Wait God-dammit!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Stop her!
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Um, well...
Well...
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
What?
Frances.
An actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I know, but --
Dick, we need some time apart --
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dick...
You want his name?
I know you believe that.
Thank you.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
You really want to go?
Always. Always.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Thank you.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Fifteen.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Yeah, well --
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
What?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Yeah.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
I guess.
Who?
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
No.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Your big speech?
The speech? Real good.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Mama, what's...
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
You kill me, Mama.
Where are you going?
Not long.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I'm going out!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
But what -- 
It ain't for lack of trying.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Sedate her.
Yeah?
You're kidding.
I don't know.
There is something I want.  A friend.
A brain. Extremities.
I will not! Kill me now!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
It's been months. It's not like him.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Only you.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Why the change? What about your work?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Open this door for no-one!
It wouldn't dare.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Very well then.
As a march hare.
Can you think of a better reason?
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
No. He had more important work.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
No. They don't.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Victor, explain yourself.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Madness?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
I finished the boats.
I don't know.
Almost five.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Wet. I don't know.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Umhummmmph.
Rocky Road.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
That's thirty percent.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Have you ever been there before?
So let's do it.
I'm exhausted.
Scott and Kate.
In heaven.
Auto wreck.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Real McCoy.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Forever together.
In the Winnebago.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Kate, Scott?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Daddy's dead.
-- you got your shower --
Whatsamatter?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
Feels good.
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
What?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
I did?
We are?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
Where are you right now?
Where are you?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
It don't look together.
Okay, I'll have one.
Yeah, it's mine.
Thank you, ensign.
That's what I hear.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Did you hear?
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Absolutely not.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
I can make this wall without --
Sir?
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Just like you would be.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I don't know, I don't care.
Thanks, Wick.
They had to kill 'em?
That's a good story.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Should I be afraid?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
No.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
You knew about us?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
The first female President?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
We know, Audrey.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
No.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
Nesting?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
That's the problem. He did.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
They are with me!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
But you don't know for sure!
You don't have the authority to do that.
Are you sure? How do you know?
You were right.
It's okay. I know her.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Like YOU know?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Shut up.
You could order something in.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
Down there.
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Up.
Yes?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
All systems are working, Commander.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
It's ... incredible.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
You smiled at me.
Only answers to me.
Tell them? About...
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
I don't think that's a cloud...
Why does this sound so familiar?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Nothing. Hold please.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
You have ten seconds.
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Simpler.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
But there it is!...
You can oc that?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
Pedal to the metal...
Get oacK on their tail.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
It is.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
I?  You all know my history.
Same old story.
You go too far, Benedict.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
A lot of years have gone by.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
We better, Congress invented him.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
No one knows...
Yes, I believe so.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Gag on your own invention, then.
You invented this, this...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
I think I heard that.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
We're leaving them?
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
But not more than your comfort.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Well, we must be who we must be...
I think I will disappoint you.
That land belongs to the strongest.
Come here, Farrah...
Calm down, Bear...
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
I have to ask you for that key.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
She can't talk right now.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
You serious?
Leo, I don't know.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
He owes me money.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
I'm in the movie business.
Not yet. I just started.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
Maybe a few times I have.
Harry, look at me.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
"Mr. Lovejoy".
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Let's see how we get along.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
One of mine?
Martin, look at me.
That's not bad.
Buddy?
Compass.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
You broke in?
What if it was?
I know what a vig is.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
You're as bad as Harry...
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
That's what the guy said.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Pick 'n' Save.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
You seem to feel fine about it.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Really.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
That's what it says.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
What?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Smugglers maybe.
Sounds reasonable.
Turbine rotor's shot.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
So whoever did this might still be around.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You smashed it!
Conveniently enough for you.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Right.
There's a charming thought.
Right.
I bet you did.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
You're a pal.
No.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
You're more practical than superstitious.
The guy. He just came this way.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
Same. Any luck?
February first.
If it was a ship she hit.
Showing you what?
What's that supposed to mean?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
We hit land.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Of course they did.
What do you say, Dodge?
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Yeah.
You're up late.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
YES.
What is it now?
Are you going to yell at me?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Oh my God, that's HIM!
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Yeah, well... hi...
Can I come in?
I guess.
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
You loser.
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Good.
Just look at them!
Or maybe not.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I remember every minute of that party.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Gross!
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
I don't believe you.
Where did you get that?
Where?
No way... when?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Go ahead...
God, you're really obsessed...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
So should I come over?
What are you talking about? Who?
Great...
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
That's all you're bringing?
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Well, we won't keep you.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Yes.
You're late, asshole.
I did too!
What?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Indian records?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
I really didn't get a good look at her.
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Really?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
And you like them?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
But, I...
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
I wish I could see him.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Why don't we start with that next week?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
But overall, you're pleased?
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
I assure you we came close many times-
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
What?
You mean nobody died?
What did I do?
That's very considerate.
What happened to them?
Why?
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Once... 
Underneath.  Somewhere.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Do you ever see him?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Oscar!  You poor kid!
We definitely had a moment or two.
Thanks.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
I know.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
-- the sorrow --
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Get on with it, counselor!
Did I forget something?
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Something good --
No, the slime is rising.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
I'll get one more reading.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I'm ready.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Wonder what?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
No?  What do I act like?
Are you all right?
That's it.  Get out.
Goodbye.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I want you inside me.
Talk to my accountant. 
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
Is that a game?
Die in what sense?
What calls?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
Why do you want to see it?
That's "Peck!"
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Then my theory was correct.
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
I'm always serious.
What is it?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Oh, shit!
She said he was "the Destructor."
Gozer.
I blame myself.
Neutronize.  System shut.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Looked at with your eyes.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I'm sure, I don't know.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
They won't break this one.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
I don't know...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
They're studying with Cynics.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
No.
I'd love some.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
Wait a minute.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Yes.
No.
Oh my God --
Ah. Where?
Because -- I am.
Elaine -- I love you.
You've got to tell me what she said.
My belt.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Yes.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Mr. McQuire.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Because I don't like you.
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
What? No. Nothing.
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Is what a girl?
What?
What?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Why not?
Well I don't know.
So?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Right.
Get away from that door.
Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
That's fine.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Yes.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute!
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Well?
How about art.
Don't you?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
There!
I walk out.
What?
No.
Is it?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
Art.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Yes.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
But I don't want you to make up something.
About an hour ago.
About what?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No. She doesn't know about it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Oh no.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Yes, sir.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
That's quite a statement.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Mrs. Robinson?
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
You can't.
Not with strangers.
Oh -- work!!
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Where downstairs?
Sorry.
Will you do me a big favor?
Yes --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Yes -- I do understand.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
I should like to smoke.
You are beautiful!
Oh -- 
I don't want them now.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Bless you --
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Yes, quite.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Ready, Baron.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
All of that at once, Baron?
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
I thought she was splendid!
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
I did not ask your advice.
Be quiet.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No, Doctor.
No, doctor.
Send his bags up to my room.
What, Doctor?
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes -- that --
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
You don't understand that do you?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Moreover...
That's from skiing.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
A thousand marks -- 
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Shhh -- here he is now.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
We did not approach you.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Oh -- but it can't be.
Why not?
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
-- We must do something...
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
You are late. Hurry.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
That.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
What's that, Lilly?
Henry, no!
Can't move.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
What? He's going to be all right!
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
It's not your fault.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
So I heard.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
No?
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Fair enough.
I guess I owe you my life.
Bluebell came in?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
You must have some money.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Never.
I don't see why not.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Always, for you, baby.
You called the doctor, huh?
I want to know everything about you.
Mama!
That's just Lilly's way.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I'm a salesman.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Where?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Sure.
Open your door.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I went out to Delmar.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
What?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Happy to see you looking so good.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
That don't match either of the victim's.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Do I know you?
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No shit.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
Forget it.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I was trying to protect you from this...
I don't know.
John, you can't help her now.
That would work.
Why not?
Can I come in?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Who?!
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
You're right.  It does sound strange.
I can't believe this is happening.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
You can't expect us to stay here --
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
I'll meet you over there.
This is madness, Wynn.
It was you.
Jamie's baby ...
Stay away, Sam.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No one.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
You know what gets me?
How all the magazines show tits today.
The hell with the diamonds!
Let's talk about it some other time.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
First Nagasaki--now this.
You know me, boy.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
Maybe it's time you got out.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
If what?
How are you, honeybunch?
You've come to the right man.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
You're hollow, like a woman.
Out!  Out!
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Are you--do you--
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
She met him at college.
What's good about that?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Mhravitch.
Where did you get the poison?
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
No, no, no, no, no.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Penelope!
Scat!
Damn.
Leave a tip.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Ram it up your ass!
You're wrong.
People don't use that word any more.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
I plan to live one hundred years!
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
He's dead, you know.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I've literally got to run!
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Would you say that again?
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
Comical?
I'm high as a kite.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
King Arthur.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Poison.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
More clowning!  Don't you see?
I've enjoyed being man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
That is sad.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
He's alive!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
That man is your father.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He is my father.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Far as I know.
How nice.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
How long has this been going on?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
Meaning?
It's a jungle out there.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
But is she, has...
What are you doing?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Do you want to take a session?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Wait?
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
What girls you got here?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
What's that shade of blue called?
Sam?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Yeah. How did you know?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Tod might know.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Something like that. How much do you make?
Three hundred?
Half now, half later.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
A friend.
She's dead.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Not very.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Fuck.
No, please go on.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
On your own land?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
...What do you have to offer?
Yeah.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What are you paying me for?
What do you mean?
They are?
But the police...
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
Like what?
Does she know anything about this?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
What?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
That's not true, Mr...?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know nothing, man.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
What do you think of that? Or this?
You never heard of that?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
I'm worried about Jake.
To anybody.
You're taking a big chance.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Yes, I am.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
No, no. I just took it.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
None of that, lady.
Is this your shovel?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Nice to meet you.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's very interesting.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Eh, fine.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Certainly a new experience for me.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Because they are all the same.
Look.
Over there by the courthouse.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
But what?
Is he all right?
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I don't...
Superb.
I don't know.
Yes. It's almost there.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
It's so blue.
With Life.
What is it, Harold?
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
Maude.
I took them out.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
To whom?
Can't complain.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Does that worry you?
No.
Yes.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Eh?
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
She took my head.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
She certainly has.
God, that's terrible.
What?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
Finish what?
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Then why are you here?
And what about you?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Yeah.
The Cenobites.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
We're on the move.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
I knew those men better than you did --
I won't take 'em. They never work.
No. Don't --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not hungry.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
He's just pushy.
Coffee's warming me up.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
Who are you?
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
You can keep them.
Kirsty?
Forget him.
Who are you?
What do you want me to do.
Who?
What?
You promised me an explanation.
Let me see.
Who did?
I said no.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Which is where?
I saw everything.
You mean we're moving in?
I hear you.
Why not?
Shit.
So damn stupid.
Are you O.K.?
Can I get you anything?
Sure.
What's wrong with you?
Please...
Not much.
You want something to drink?
I... suppose so, yes.
I prefer the floor.
Yeah, why don't I?
Try me.
I found a room.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Really?
What's the problem?
I AM house-trained.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
What happened to you?
Say it.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
No way.
No, you can't.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
I have all of the others.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Fine.  That's great.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
What's his name?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Fine.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
It's Vince and Justin.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
And do you like it that way?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Fine.  One.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
Have you slept with him yet?
I guess.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
Pig died.
No, no.  When are you going home?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't want to go back.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Okay.
No, but...
You're being stupid.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I don't know.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
How're you holding up?
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
It's a crematorium.
Good.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
That way.  You?
How's the store?
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Nice.
Thanks.
I don't follow you.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Probably.
Tradition.
Where?
Have you gone to the police?
Go home.
No one knows you're here?
Not all of them.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
At least.
You won't.
Why are you here?
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in '31?
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
No!
It'll never stick.
Never take up poker, Detective.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Please go to no trouble.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
You know me home.  Me name.
Yes.  Always.
You are still so very young.
No!
Go to hell.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
That is not me.
Who?
Certainly not me.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
If you wish to play games, Major.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Where did you learn that?
Your father must be smart.
Figure she's with him?
You'd think he'd had practice.
I don't know.
Head still secure to the neck.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
He always did.
Are you here?
Where were you Tuesday night?
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
Same.
I'm sure that's true.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Seventy-five.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
I lost my wallet.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Thank you.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
You'll ask me to what?
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
What?!!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
I know, Walter, but I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Dead?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
No!
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
What's his line?
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Thanks.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
We're not interested.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Where's Butch?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Thanks.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What's the matter with my brains?
You know you did!
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
You said it!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Three bullets! Any good?
All right -- all right!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
What have you got, Hildy?
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Yeah. But I --
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Five hundred dollars.
Editorials?
I'm telling you!
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
And up a dime.
Mother!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Keep away!
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
The what?
No, I don't think so.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Apparently so.
I don't mind.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Would.
He's the worst liar.
...and four and five...
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
I don't know?
Kiss me Hardy.
You need trees for an avenue.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Jam.
You taste it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
The ideas you get in your head.
Out.
There, there, my baby.
Who said anything about love?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Grace!
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Huh... what cone?
Who's your Daddy!
Come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Hey, wait take this.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What?
What!
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
It won't work.
What I need are some answers. 
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Tickets for what?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Sleeping.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
Keys.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
I pray to God there is.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
That must be him.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
It's embarrassing, okay?
Woof.
French?
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
When you were a little French girl?
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Hmmmph.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
No!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
That's Lila?
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It's okay, Puff.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
One night stand?
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Three foot one.
Nathan told my brother.
Oh, Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
I'm not sure.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
I like you, too, Nathan.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
All right.
You are an animal.
Such as what womanly things?
Oh boy!
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Yes.
Lila...
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Even better.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
here, here.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yep.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
That's right, Miss Packard.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Good, good.
You ever played billiards before?
Thought you only drank milk.
Yeah? Why?
What is?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
To do what?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
How good is he?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
I said we're leavin'.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Want some free advice?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
I don't want it.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
A son.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
Aw, Eddie.
Now and then. Why, do you?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
You're a pretty good player.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
What bus?
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Come here.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
You want to go with me?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Haven't you opened it?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's this supposed to mean?
What's it so hot in here for?
Would he know?
Yes, I'm glad.
Come here. Come on, now.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Why?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
California. Oakland.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
No.
Yes.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
With them?
We move.  Place to place.
My wife.
Yes.
What do you mean?
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Stay alive.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
You got that right.
Round back.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
That's the Air Force Base.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Sure ... fine.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I left it at work.
Good night.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Yes.
I'd believe him.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
What happened to your other slipper?
Oh?
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
You have to leave the White House.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
David, don't...
I take it you've heard.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Dad, don't start.
Three years.
It's perfect the line is busy?
Moishe, please, don't talk.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Then God help us.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
Better than we thought.
And our troops here?
But what, General?
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Butt-munch.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
We're already over Mach 2!
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
You sure?
We're leaving.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Where?
What?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Yes?
In that case, I permit you.
Lower me down.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
I came to get you! What do you think?
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
He was actually there? You saw him?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
So did I.
My lucky charm.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What???
Head for the fireplace!
I'm out, Dad!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
What final challenge?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
But, Indy --
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My name is Kazim.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Lao She.
I don't like to show off.
Step on it, Short Round!
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Why they glow like that?
Why?
Behind you!
What?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
No -- real food.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Willie!
Quiet!
I'm going down.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
Yes.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
I know you did!
Me.
Yes.
What is your name?
...I need to make a phone call.
Right.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Me? What'd I do?
Loading a gun.
Hear voices don't I.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why not?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Too late...They want you.
We have to get out of here.
Go out, take your first left.
With Authority!
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
What about it?
Who cares?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
You eat it.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Follow it.
Try another language.
How should I know?
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
No...you idiot!
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Rene...
Well you did it today.
The beautiful one.
I don't know!
I can't keep up.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
What do I do?
Don't worry!
A hard left. A hard left.
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Well...?
And don't let her know, either.
It'll remind me of you.
I insist.
Don't worry.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
It's a long story.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
I have a new client.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
Oh.
What things?
Oh....Sure.
What?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
I noticed you staring.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
No. No one to speak of.
Without what?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Why?
You're talking to me.
You seemed interesting.
They kidded me a little.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Why?
I'm just on vacation.
We figure out if it's in here.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Hong Kong.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
You coming along?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
I can't fly it.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
That I really don't know.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Do something!
That's twenty feet high.
I told you, I work for him.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
Why are you on to him?
It is?
Perfectly.
It doesn't hurt.
What does he know?
So we better get started.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
Monday.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Good.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
What caliber is your gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
What about you, you got a crew already?
"Mike?"
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay.  Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Try the car.
I didn't want to leave it there...
No, thank you.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes"?
Hello? Yeah...
Jeffrey...
No, you do not.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Yeah.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
You eating with us?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
Why am I gonna mention your name?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
I'll call them, Lowell.
What?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
ABC...?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
What?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
There is -- there is no family.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Well, I wouldn't say --
They hate each other --
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
I had no idea until after, but --
Who's the pigeon?
Triple!
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
No frown lines.  New watch?
Set one side for Bel Air.
Got any symptoms?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Did you see the tape?
Howard is a beautiful person.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
She held that against you?
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
I know.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Miles.
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
May I come in?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
No buts. Now. Out.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Marylin!
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Sometimes I forget.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
He has a reputation for being tough.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Yes?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
We've outlined a settlement...
Mm.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
She always looked out for me.
Nothing.
Sorry.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
What are they?
HA!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
-- the coin?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
The reward.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, yes. I heard.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
I don't know.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
No, I'll go through with it.
Why? Do you know him? 
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, Dad—
Lower the boats!
Yes, sir.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Any others?
What do they say?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Huh?
Oh—the papers—
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Yes.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Outside!
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yeah?
Um. You're doing all right.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Next week "East Lynne."
What's the matter?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I'm following you.
Of course it is.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
What?
Well, take them off.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
What?
What if nobody stops for us?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Come on! come on! 
A black eye. 
Darling!
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Nope.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
You bet I did.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Come here, you little fool!
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Yes?
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Yeah.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I am, Joe.
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Collect?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Why—no—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Go on, Willie.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
What?
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
It's going to get worse, honey.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Between six and seven seconds.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
No.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
She's the best damn witness we have!
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
And what would I have to do?
Not a problem.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'll call her.
Who was there for your ass?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
I need a favor.
A bit.
I can't believe you do me this way.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I found out.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Arrest me.
That's my diet shit.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
Can I see your I.D.?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Great.
Was she helpful?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
It was the other guy who busted me.
He's got that kinda money?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
'74, I think.
Why?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's not really something I think about.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Bigger?
I don't care.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
The day you got me out of jail?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Tell him you want to see him?
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I'm sure.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I'm just tired in general.
I beg your pardon?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Yeah?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
You never asked me if I did or not.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
What are you doing?
You talk to him?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Kinda.
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
They asked.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
I told them.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Bank robbery.
It's a diet thing?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
And your point is?
Uh-huh?
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Yeah, down the end.
Okay, Lou-is.
Are you serious?
Okay.
The moon -- I dunno
I'm in my underwear.
So we on the same page then?
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Sure.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Did you get it?
You know how she is.
Pretty sure.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Watcha gonna see?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
What?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I was gonna tell you...
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
What isn't happening?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! Oh God.
It's short, huh?
Just my luck.
It's hard to explain.
They're not interested, Jake.
Maybe the demons are real.
I'm hanging up.
She talk about the boys?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
But I see them.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
I don't want to know.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Your back? Did you fall?
Who did?
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Where is the lamp?
I don't know.
No. The little one.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Why you left.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
How's it going?
What's wrong?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
Show me Della!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
That's your decision.
Am I home?
What?
I love you, Jez.
What's he talking about?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I can do anything I want.
Me neither.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down, Jake.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Sit down, Jake.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
You know who I am.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
So why tell me now?
Never?
One drop?
Just relax.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I don't know what to say.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Total delirium.
Help me!
Nothin' much.
I need to see you, Jake.
I need to see you.
Nope.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's wrong?
That black car?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Speaking of which, duck!
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
We don't have a choice!
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
What are you doing back?!!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
I am an expert!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
You just keep an eye out.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Fuckin A...
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
We have to get off this ship.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
What if we don't?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
I think so, why?
I get it.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Again?! Jesus!
You lost the charge?
GO, GO, GO!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
You need to get laid!
Oh shit! There he is!
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Ow!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Keep trying!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Obviously so.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Old Earth?
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Sure but what good will that do?
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
My boat's neat, dad!
You got it.
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Michael! Come inside!
Do I need any more authority?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Why?
My kids were on that beach...
What d'ya mean?
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I wish it would rain...
No...  You think we can get back with those?
I can't imagine why.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
We never had any. What's the problem?
That wasn't funny.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Set?
Twenty years.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is anyone having this...?
Is that a boat?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
No way! He can't!
He's under!
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I don't have it.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I'm supposed to be running.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
I'll try to drop by later.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Were we together?
I totally heard you did.
Um, hi?
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
What do you play?
Oh.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Commercials.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What are you?
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I went to the doctor today.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Nothing.
Congrats.
You're pregnant?
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
That is sick, man.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Share the love, Tits!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
Hm.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Yeah, downtown.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Carrie.
...Yeah.
So you don't do any of those things.
How'd you meet Early?
Early, you are so sweet.
As many times as it takes.
Early, sing me a song.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Walter Livesy.
Vernon, Florida.
Turkey mostly.
No sir.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
...Ha.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Thank god!
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I do.
I don't want to talk about it.
Look again!
I'm finished.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
No.
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
Shut your mouth.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...That'd be my guess.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
You fucked it?
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
How?
Yeah.
Yep.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah me too nigga.
Who?
Why I give pennies?
What are you talking about?
Good luck?
I don't know. How much do you want?
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
You are?
Hold up man.
Right here.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Hold on.
Is it cold?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah?
Yes.
But I'm scared Telly.
Bang up stuff.
Do you care about me?
One.
No.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
No, I didn't bleed.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Good luck.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Whah is dissdee?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yep.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah I get bored.
It's me. Telly.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Yep.
It's grandmother style.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
What?
I wouldn't know.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Get off me!
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Run it down.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Sanderson?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
It's a voice modulator.
Did anyone stand out?
What was suspicious about him?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
You're not going to tell me that.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
You like to brag, don't you?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
The police haven't told you?
The game's over.  You lost.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Fuck off!
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Boys.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
My cheering section.
Okay.
No Frank.  No prints.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
We're not sure.
It's important.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
It's alright.
Yes.
How come you don't stay with them?
Uh huh.
Yes.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I don't think I could.
Let's change the subject.
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
And you?
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Then why are you backing up?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Because she killed herself!!
I'm sure you are.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Colwyn.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You won't have to.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
What do you see?
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Yes.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Where the spiral begins.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
You have done it?
Yes.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I have need of friends.
How did you know I had sons?
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
I don't think it's working.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Hush!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
With an old voice?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
The Widow of the Web?
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
It is too late. He has drunk.
Ynyr!
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
It is no trickery.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
OK.
Yes, yes...
What?
No, you can't go out.
I never rent my gear.
What?
Mathilda?!
...17.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Yes.
Yeah, what?
Mathilda, listen!
...I got lost, Mister.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Fine...
Huh?
...And how much is it?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
No... Dino's.
No...
I have new dreams now.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Maybe later.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Pardon?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You have?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
We can do it together.
I don't follow.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
Please tell me.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Yes.
Go to sleep Ellen.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Pacifica, California.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
About my love for her.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
What was that?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Pulitzer, here I come.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
California.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She knew you loved her.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
What, come on?
Steph.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
No.
No -- S.E.R.A.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Are you serious.
You do?
You OK out there?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
OK.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
When?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Be careful.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Let's stay for a while.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Yes.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Where have you been staying?
No.
Yuri... are you...
That's right.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Go to hell.
Are we done for today?
Get up.
That's not what's important.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Who could better understand than me?
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
I guess.
Yes.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
-- uh --
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Spill.
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
You're kidding!
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
What?!
No way --
Neat.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Thanks again for your help!
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Maybe not to your face...
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Absolutely!
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I got bangs!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
So are you!
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
No, silly. I go here.
What, like it's that hard?
Thank you.
Yes.
Chuck.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Always.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I don't expect you'd understand.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
It's terrible.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Gump, is it?
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I fear she's lost.
Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Blackheart?
Jack, don't!
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one...
We'll find it.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Nay.  This time we strike first!
No... but what choice have we?
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
That's it!
The wound is mortal.
Can you save her?
I don't... understand.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Never show mercy!
I've not heard a note out of you.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Go on... go on...
I'll try.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
I'm not its master.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
To fetch your napkin.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
You've freed me, Jack...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Lili... I love you!
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
You'll visit again?
Sorry.
No fear of that now.
Only that?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You... you... you mortal you!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
We wait.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Sam!
Since seventh grade.
It's so beautiful.
Mom said I should.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Who are all these people?
No.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
No thanks.
I can use your mom's.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
I'm not gay.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Months.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
She's out with a friend.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
You'll have money when you work for it.
Oh, okay.
A friend of yours is here.
I might have a solution.
Sit down for a second.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
Hi, Mom.
What do you know about me?
He's got nothing to do with me.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
That's so weird...
Are you taking them still?
I'd build a house.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
I want you to find someone for me.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
But you can't call me while you think?
Where will you live?
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Let's go.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
What?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
My stupid back.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Left you?
So could I.
No.
Who?
His father is a man.
Sooner than the Fall.
I know.
What are you doing home?
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Why?
I didn't go in your room.
Why?
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
Dad's home, already?
Hell with him. It ain't that.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She got married last month.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Yes, boss.
Here!
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
You need collateral.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
He does it all by himself.
Yeah.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Say what?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Whatever.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
That's the way it is.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
'Course I was right. About what?
Why the hell not?
So?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
What were they, bootleggers?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Anybody else need anything read?
That's a long story...
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
You shouldn't have come here.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
...their damned souls will be ours.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Noon...
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
So excited.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Angels don't get any older, son.
You're already there...
No.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
By she, do you mean he?
Oh, would you grow up.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
You keep a bat under your seat?
All right...
I'll just go to Heaven.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Really?
If you want to.
Sometimes, sure.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Why would you be floating?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
I have to, Valerie.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Where do you send them?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Just the face.
Just wondered... what happens?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm in my party mood.
It has nothing to do with you.
He was killed.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
I changed my mind.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
You know.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Of course --
That's nice.
But what is this -- why?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
How will they know we're coming?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
I won't.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
I have always been here...
Gracious... no.
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
His or ours?
Are you positive he knows?
We should stop seeing each other.
Andy?
Alice, I...
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yeah? what did they want?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
No.
His physical condition.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Out in back.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
We'll get a tail put on him.
Coming up.
Not even close.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
That's absurd.
Alice who?
No, nothing.
What night?
Yeah?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
What?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Just a minute.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Yeah.
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You really don't remember?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Fossils.
Well, what do you know about that!
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Oh, really?
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
I'll say.
Over by that hill.
When are you going to start?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
So there are others?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Yes, charming.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Oh, I'm so glad.
Why, no.
Now, what would you like to do?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
Dead?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
That's what you said.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
All right. Sorry, George.
Why not?
You're wrong, George.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
I wonder.
Bump?
You see, it's not a dream.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Struggling, why?
Why, mother?
I'd love it!
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
It's Fenner.
English!
Yes.  Barney!
Please don't go.
All right, I'll be there.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
What happens if I say no?
Yes, sir.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
I'd go with number three.
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
So what's the problem?
Why?
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
And what's this ... ?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Get back in the car!
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Why not?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
No.
You figured what?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
You're not taking me in!
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I dunno. One?
It's... coming.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Noon exactly.
They're not my pals--
Will it lower the curve?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Oh shit!
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Is it now?
They're inside.
Please --
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Found?  Where?
I know... I do, too...
I can't even stand up --
The nano... what?
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
Try again.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Uh-huh...
Hang on, Lamar --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
What?
I go running down there.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
I show a cop on horseback.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
No maglev system.
We're in motion on something.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
Yes, it is.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
You gonna tell on me?
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
So?
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Good-bye, Dad...
NO!
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
You're not gonna kill me...
I'm a little dizzy...
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
The system would collapse.
Hold that thought.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
My God...
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
What?
Where are you?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
I wanna kill my boss.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Two?
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
We used to, every summer.
But there's still the other two.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
No thank you.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
What if I gave you forty?
See you later.
Manhattan.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Mommy's not home?
What time is it there?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
What'd you say?
I don't get it.
She'll be out in a minute.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
No.
Quick drop. In and out.
No.
Ruiz knows about this?
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Yeah.
What is it?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
What drill?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Well, this is the corner.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Understand me?
He's not here.
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you.
Bye.
Shhh...
You wanna go right now?
It's not even yours.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
You sure?
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
You would think.
You got that right.
Fine.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
We don't need guns.
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
You're not getting a gun.
Easy...
I'll be a minute.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
Why? What I say bad?
You really in trouble?
Watch it...
Here...
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Word.
No. What is it?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
We're going to New York?
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
What?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
A rose by any other name would --
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Heard where?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Solid, daddy.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Now.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Tell Him that.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Why do you ask?
Are you?
You're with me even when you're away.
Because you're in trouble.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Shhh!
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Sure, man.
What?
If she got eyes, she do.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
500.
Please make way, please --
How long has this been going on?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Fine as May wine.
Eat lead, coppers.
You the man!
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
What can you do?
I'm the man.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Watch your tongue, boy.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
So where do we begin?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Daniel what?]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I believe you.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Different door. Not far from here.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Time will tell.
No.
I'm not crying.
It's better to be free, right?
You need to practice.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I'm sorry.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Because...  I was already dead.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
[Yes.]
This is Mr. Creasy.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
I think it's fantastic.
Hmm?
[Is that good or bad?]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
So am I.
That's what friends do.
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
You told me.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm having a very good time, too.
I don't.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Please...
Nothing.
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'll see you around.
That's the one.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
You gonna get married.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Hey, Ang'...
Well...
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Home.
Hospital.
Back home.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
I don't drink intoxicants.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Perfectionist.
Duke Forrest.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Sixteen times.
Call Dago Red.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
People will talk.
We're a good team.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
What?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
C-A-M-E-M...?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
No, no, that one.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Homosexuality.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Morning, Radar. How were things?
I can try, sir.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah, maybe.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
Who?
John Doe, the one in the speech.
About me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
How do you do.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
A deal?
John Doe.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Oh.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Yeah, a little.
I used to pitch.
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Naw.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
What Bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
John Doe Club?
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Why—uh—
How?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Did you want to see her about something important?
That's too bad.
I didn't see anything.
SWAT wants to go in.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Yeah, okay.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Of course.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
What happened, Mike.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
They want Walter dead!
Is that where you're family lives?
Automatic.
What's the suspect's name?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Being faxed over now.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Spread it out.
Like it had to be done.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
So what do I say to this guy?
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Okay, stop.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Only that floor.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Greg.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You heard.
Can I come in?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Yeah that's it.
And you think he'll...
Use your imagination.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
A deeper level?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Depends. What's up?
Your concern is heartwarming.
You let us worry about that.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it!
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
I need to take back what's mine.
True.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Yes.
Wake up?!
True.  But why?
Not my problem.
In a computer program.
It's not real.
It's his nature.
-- He will.
New York.
Who?
-- He won't.
-- Yes.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
The truth.
Katie was digitized.
Why would I do that?
Tanner.
Yes.
Realize?
Yes.
Checking connection.
Male.
Speed?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
I've never been this sore in my life.
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Activating Power Beam!
What does that mean?!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Activating Power Scope!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Awwh, Charlie.
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me about it.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Scared.
Could we step outside?
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
What's that divided four ways?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Who hired the bastard?
For being a bootlegger?
I needed to see you again.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I'm doin' business here!
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Come off it, Bugs.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
They're friends of our enemy.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
What about the share.
And the Jews?
That's why I'm here.
I'll take care of the Boss.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Masseria's been after me too.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Uhh - martini?
Sad commentary, huh?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
<u>Why</u>??
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Why?
A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
YOU SET ME UP!!
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Ohhh, nothing.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
We like to think so, yeah.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Aaron?
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Mm hmm.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
... Manly?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
... Oh ...
This way?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Thanks very much, sonny--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Who?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Shut up, Diz.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
No--not offhand--
Susan? Nah!
You said it!
He's a house-afire!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Ma! Hold him!
The--head?
What stuff?
Than what?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Mr. President!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
For a question!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Here--where are you running off to?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
No, Jeff--please--!
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Convene?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Tonight.
Yes, I see that.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Have I?
Terrible, thank you.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
No--
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Second drawer.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Are you drunk?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Wait--
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Goodnight, Senator--
Well! You don't say!
Yes, sir--
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Ring the call to quorum.
How's that, buddy?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Okay. See you here.
What do you mean?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Do you?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
He did it.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim, you don't have to--
It's crucifying him--!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Order!
Sometimes twice.
Yes, you own it.
No, no children.
Thank you very much.
Your Honor!
No! I resigned last week!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
Oh - uh - nothing.
What are they going to do?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'd like to read it some time.
Let's just walk, okay?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Boy, was he burning.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
I wanna see that guy!
Better wire him right away, John.
What was that you said he was?
Mr. Cedar!
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Okay.
How do you do.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Uh-huh.
Entertainment?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
They can have the Estate.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Not at all.
Binge?
Don't pay any attention to her.
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Prairie? Oysters?
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
What, sir?
Yes, sir.
How did they threaten you?
One hundred books?
What's that?
Why's that?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
A friend?
Ernest, what do you think?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
How do you mean?
Mr. Follett.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry, your honor.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Okay.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Sure.
You're good.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Oh... not a real doctor.
What do you mean?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Hmm.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Sorry... I'm done.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Either one.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Yeah?
I don't know if --
Of course.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
I'm glad.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
What?
Weekly or monthly?
It's my bit for the community.
Where was this?
What happened today?
Do you think that's what he wants?
What'd he say?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
He agreed?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Is that the question?
I understand.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Yep.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
See you Thursday... regular time.
You're completely reliable.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
What?
Relax, I got him.
I've had worse.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
What friend? You're my only friend.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
I am an English woman.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Very slowly.
That bad huh?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Got what?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
What's it look like!?
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you knew I'd know.
Of course.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
One last tweak.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Really?
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
I'm the Bowler.
Hello?
Doctor Heller?
Thanks.
He's dead.
I got it.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Really?
Sure -- I guess.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Roy.
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What are you talking about?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
And you are a fool.
My heart died a long time ago.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
See ya tomorrow.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
No.
Hey... he's gone.
Mother... it's not what you think!
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
Sorry.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a delightful idea!
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
What do you have in mind?
Are you serious?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
It is a terrible shock.
That is incredible.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir, I am.
A glass of champagne, please.
Yes, I am.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
It is the work of incendiaries.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I very much doubt that he will.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Do you have three francs, sir?
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
No.
Yes.
I don't understand you.
Promises mean nothing.
Open the door.  It's me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Five minutes.
Yes.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
Why not?
What are you talking about?
God help me -- yes.
I know.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
No.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Thanks, Unc.
I'm his cousin.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
You know what he mean, dude.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
Black magic.
Cheeco.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Okay, plan B.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Out the door and to the left.
Nothing.
Sorry about today, man.
No.
Me too.
Why didn't she put'em out?
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Hold on.
I said hold on!
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
I do.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
You could sell your Beamer.
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
This is a knock.
I don't know.
Nothing.  What you want?
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Shut yo' ass up.
Oooh, ba-by!
Elroy.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
What you doing to my nephew?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Indeed.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
I'd like to know what...
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Yes, I'm listening.
What's your point?
Tell me why I miss him.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
You know what I'm gonna do.
I think you're right.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
No way.
Right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
All right.
Keep it.
I remember. The big tipper.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What are you going to do?
Don't think I won't.
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
You're a big girl, huh?
Help me get her off the rug.
Shut up.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
I kill her anyway.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
And I won't never tell about the money.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
You have all sinned!
About what!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Bluebeard!
The money, Icey.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Amen.
How?
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
There! What's so hard about that!
'Cause you're too little.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
John! Don't!
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
No. No.
It -- she --
Yonder.
Mm-hm.
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
No. No one never did.
Pearl and John.
Yes; from the first night.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I was praying.
I -- no, I --
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
My flesh and blood!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What's wrong, John?
The Drugstore?
What you been up to?
No, nothing.
I sure as hell hope so.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Get the kit!
Because he was scary, that's why.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Uh-oh...
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
You do?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Okay. Hi, dad.
You don't know he did it.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Nancy!
Dead and gone.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Naturally, Comrade.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Tell me... what else did you have?
What was it like?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
And there?
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Possibly.
That's another thing... it's spring.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
How many families live here with you?
Monsieur.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
That's right.
I must be stern with you.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Good evening, Monsieur.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
What is it, my boy?
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Get out of here!
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Razinin.
A cow?
Brave... that's right.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
That's even better.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
Well, we're back home.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Au revoir.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Why should I take a chance?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You're welcome.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
I will do my best.
Yes.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
I don't like your following me.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
No.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Anything, Ninotchka.
My darling.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No speech?
I know... it's the Russian soul.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
But I can throw it out of the window.
It is their wish.
Please.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
No.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
No... please...
Yes.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
We have nothing to discuss.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I must insist that you leave.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
May I ask why?
May I ask what has happened?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Where do you eat?
Where is that?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
You did say it, sir.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
So ... let's go ...
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
I figured that out.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
He wants money.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
That's what they're doing.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
I don't know anything about that.
Sir?
That fruitcake!  What about him?
What's Liddy got?
We were working on China.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
"Security" is not strong enough.
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
What?
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Why me?
Yes, Mother ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
What ... ?
My friends call me "Mister President."
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Winning?
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
I beg your pardon --
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Why?
Looks can be deceiving ...
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hello ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Elvis I like, too.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Sir?
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Is that the truth?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Do you really want this, Dick?
Can I just ask for one thing?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Most don't.
I'm... discouraged.
Try "old" on for size.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Nothin'?
Some pretty bad people.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
I don't know...
No. Probably I don't.
So when was he here?
Wasn't no bullet.
Yes sir.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
That's very nice.
I always am.
I can't plan your day.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
No. But I gave my word.
Goin' out.
Well -- how come?
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Yes ma'am?
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Not a bleep.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Well -- where ya goin'?
Yeah? Where am I?
You know she won't be there.
No. Do you?
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Sixty-nine cent.
I was just passin' the time.
You already asked me that.
You live in that house behind the store?
You've lived here all your life?
No.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Somethin' like that.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
What room?
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
I'm sorry.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I do like you.
Sugar?
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
You do, I reckon.
I don't know.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Yeah?
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
That's a nice name for what you need...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, I was just... How you doing?
...to see you.
I am?
"Thirty-two?"
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
...what're you saying?
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Yes, ma'am.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
No, Del.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
David, please --
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
What's so special about it?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
I came for love...
I don't know.
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Who?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
...okay.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
No, that should be more than --
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
You told me how to do it!
He told us it's in the Buick.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
...that's a good motto.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
I know that.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
A doctor on the show... why?
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
What's wrong with you?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
He's waiting...
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I'll think about it.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Uh-huh.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Gopher, Everett?
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Four hundred, Delmar.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Everett, my beard itches.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Problem a p'seption.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's right, honey.
Uh-huh.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
It was in his bureau.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
But... but...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
He ain't our daddy!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
I wrote. Not every week...
No, sir!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I'm doing okay, sir.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Pity you don't have the character.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Aw screw it...
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
How're you doing, Sarge?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
What are you tired from?
He was. He died.
Yeah.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
What do you mean?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Really?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I've never had a girl.
I'll get it if you want.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
I know that.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
He said he grew up poor?
But she expects you to marry her?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Not with me.  Not with people.
God.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
I can't just...
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Not that one.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
Not at all.
Don't!
It's just the woman and the kid?
No fucking way.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
What?
The furniture guy?
0150.
Don't.
It doesn't work?!
Give me a break.
Little bit.  Yeah.
What am I, a five year old?
I am.  I'm here.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
On it!
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
You know it brother.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Jesus...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We're like policing the police.
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Wait a second there brother...
I don't know.
Yeah... let me think about it.
Right on Brother Judge...
Brimmer.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Well, act like it. Come on.
And who is we?
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Bullshit...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
What?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
You don't look alright.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
No.
Late summer.
Uh... uh... I...
That would be nice, too.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Pride will do.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Do you?
Lovely.
With a lace table cloth?
Apology accepted.
Colonel will do.
Very well, proceed, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
That one is a bit more difficult.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Are you going to meet with him?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Not yet.  What happened?
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
It's safer if we stay together.
Oh?
Is that so?
Yes...  ... father.
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
I don't care.  I hate him.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Name five hundred.
That's five, keep going...
Gabriel.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Thank you.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Quiet.
Bite?
Well...I guess not.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yes.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Do you believe that?
You believe in it.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm sure you're not.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I think it is so, Ellie.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
I don't know.
Then come on.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Because it's right.
Wouldn't wash?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Wendigo?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
It's beautiful!
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I got eggs down here!
Louis, are you sure?
Elizabeth goes free!
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
What're you suggesting?
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Aye, for us there is.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Very well.
Thank you, sir.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Will -- you can't trust him.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Commodore, you can't do that!
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
What?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Ceremony?
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
How did he get off the island?
We're not going to just surrender!
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
I don't think that will be necessary.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
I said, no lies.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Somewhat.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Agreed!
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
This way!
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Please.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You're not rotting meat.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Nebbleman.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
No, Icky, this is real.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
That might work.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Aaabout...?
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Same old Daniel.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I guess I should be flattered.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
You're insane.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
You're the doctor.
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
No problem.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I don't know.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Like a glove.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
The same thing I suppose.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Oh yes you are!
Yeah, and what might that be?
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Certainly. Right over there.
You may go, Smythe.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
No - give you another guess.
I'm glad.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Oh, hello Mother!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
That's so.
My play.
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Quite so. Quite.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
I didn't run away.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Must be my wife.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Surely, come right in.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Why—
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
I understand, sir.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
No, sir!
That's all I wanted to know!
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Yeah?
Sure.
What?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
What?
Thanks ... I love you.
Thanks.
She's crying.
I don't know.
I was in a bowling-alley.
You want to get out of here?
I think ... I might be ill ...
What's the matter?
She won't go out with me?
That's not going to happen!
No. What?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Rain.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
You're not allowed to lie.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Yes.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
Owns the hardware store.
What?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Jen please ...
It's okay.
The pages filled in?
Wow.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
... Lover's Lane?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah.
Nice ... Nice ...
McGinty's.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
No you're not.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Listen to me!
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
TV repair?
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Hey.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
D&D Mattress Man.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Hello everyone.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Do you like porno movies?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
You have a girlfriend?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
You don't even know how much it is.
Really? Please?
I know I did. But I don't.
I have to go.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
They don't get opened until eight.
Not very well.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Hi.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Really?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
Nothing.
Ok.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Yes? I'm trying.
...yeah...
If you come to Hawaii --
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Yeah.
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
yeah.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I'm fine are you ok?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Why?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
I think you have a call?
I didn't know you had a sister?
That was weird. I meant good.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
You're goin' on a trip?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Ok.
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
What do you have in the house?
You have an ATM?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
This is a bunch of bullshit.
You can't be late though.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Sorry.
Ok.
Should I call you later?
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Yes, Abbe?
Not now, or we're both done for.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
"Turn you out?"
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
That's enough.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- that was lust --
I know, because I felt it myself --
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
His wife's influence.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
He's sworn to obedience.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Poorly.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Quite.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
What thought is that?
Of course.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
I can't
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Uh-hub.
There's no call for that language-
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
How much?
There's nothing to explain
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I don't want you to--
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Huh?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
No -- no -- I mean--
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Forget it-
Who the hell's Manolete?
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Don't do this
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
They don't have to.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
I don't care.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Again.
Again
Jesus
Please don't ask me to do this.
Ah, it's a grand title.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
We done?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Jack! Enough!
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
You want the title shot?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Yeah, I know.
C'mon, Joey.
Where you been?
Well, that's what I mean.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
At night?
Can you see it?
No.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Now take your panties off.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I say?
I never noticed his face.
Positive.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
What?
What friends?
Never felt better.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Mrs. Thorwald.
You think he's getting out of here?
Your logic is backward.
All the things I hate.
I told you that --
Like an old hambone?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
With that cast on -- you don't.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Who are you?
I don't know what you mean.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
She expects me to marry her.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's just not the girl for me.
She pay you much?
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Would four of them -- ?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Empty as a football.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Tired?
I wish there was one I wanted.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
I think it's enchanting.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Of course not.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Three.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You mean "goodnight."
Now, Lisa --
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
There's nothing to see.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
What about it?
Not yet!
Thinking about Thorwald?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Your name?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Give me some dirt.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Okay.
Yeah.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
I think I should go home.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You still want to go home, Moose?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
I was in it.
Well--
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
He's just loaded, honey.
Look--just relax, will you?
I still think you should go down.
Yes, sir.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
What's the charge?
I don't want to make friends.
Jim.  What's yours?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Not lately.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Plato!
Your father!
I'm here.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
My gun?
I need it.
Just a guard.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Mom--I'm not--
Good Lord!
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Mess that kid up?
So then you moved?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
I bet you hear everything I say!
Are you?
You disappointed?
It is for me too.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Hi.
He hates me.
He hates me.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
No.
I'll never get close to anybody.
My mother?
We were romantic then too--
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Gabriel -- !
Please, Gabriel, don't...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Yeah.
Radio said.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Nick...
You're in on this.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
What?
They're truck drivers.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
You saved me.
I'm almost done.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said it a million times!
Yes!
What?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
...never... tried...
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name.
Take 'em.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Acid-chewer.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Hi, Nick.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Not with you.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
How do we take them out?
It's a roach, guy --
Ain't there yet.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Thought you hate your old man.
What, working security?
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
You gave them me.
I'm ninety-two years old --
They changed the layout.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Did the two of you talk?
Yeah.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
What? Snap out of it!
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Dead as Dillinger.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
What do you care?
Who gives a damn?
Like hell I am.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
That's your proof?
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Don't ask me that.
You do?
Freddy Newendyke.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Down to my car.
No, I'm not!
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
It's not good...
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
How can you be so sure?
He ain't dead.
He asked.
What are you gonna do about him?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Yeah, those guys too.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Yeah.
Will she be dark or fair?
You're not going out to look for them?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
All right -- it's said!
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
It's going to Sonora.
Hurry up.
Which ranch?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Good thing you didn't.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You better start.
You want to split up? --
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
What's there to be fair about?
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
They shouldn't have done that.
I don't like to see you go.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
I don't care what he thinks.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Good night, Steve.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Do I know you?
Would you die already?!
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hey, I have an idea...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Shhh!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Can you feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Listen to me I --
But he'll kill her!
It's okay.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Yes!!!!
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
What are you getting at, Professor?
Let me see the files.
Are these all the subjects?
Any of them hot?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Alright, go to the belt store...
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Then let us prepare.
No, I'm fine.
It says, "Ray."
"Fucked me."
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
He's really cute!
MURDERED?!!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
I certainly did not.
Is there a killer loose?
She sure can pick 'em!
Thanks, Mom.
You scared me.
This is so silly. 
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Ooohhhh!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Oh, honey!
Yes, I did.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Marvin A. Pickles.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Bon Appetit!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Now, here's a babe!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Yeah —- sure.
Drink.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Hello, Frances.
"The Dante?"
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
Good.
But you do believe me?
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
But you have treated me that way.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
We've tried so long to find her.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
We could tell him.
I'm afraid.
And then?
I won't get lonely.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
But you're always at the library.
I have to go —-
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
What a peculiar question.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Perhaps
You know where she is?
Cloven hoof?
I don't know.
I'm very, very serious.
No, she's with her sister,
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
What?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
How do you mean?
I feel like they do.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
All of these are interviews?
Why not?
Yes.
Maybe you want to go.
Don't you want to make one?
Then do it.
I have money.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Yes.
Yes.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
How come?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I'm not planning on it.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Not entirely.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Well, are you?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
You've made your point.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Yes!
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
What do you mean?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you find him attractive?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Will you stop? Jesus.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Why not?
Well, why?
Then why'd you call me?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
It looks like a tablecloth.
Hold on.
No.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Talking.
That's all.
Yes.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Whichever you prefer.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
I did.
Could be risky.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Right.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
I just... Ann is very...
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Really. How'd it go?
Where are the tapes, Graham?
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yes?
Yeah.
All right, jesus.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
No. I don't think so.
OK. But late.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
We live in 703.
It's crazy.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
That you, Rog?
No? How come?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
He needs help.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Yes, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Shove it, Ralph!
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
It's...
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
YOUNG BLOOD
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
Flavors!
YOU'RE NO GOOD
CRIMINAL
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Good. That's good.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
So I guess that's it.
They're just leftovers.
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Good. How're you?
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Well, in that case...
You said you had it all lined up.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
And Lexapro, yes.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Now we're talking.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Want some?
Just a minute!
So you're going to stop acting?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
How do you know?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I want to go home now.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
What?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Understanding of what?
Yeah.
Thanks, Jack.
Obsessively.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Let's leave it alone.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Thanks.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
What's that?
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
What?
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
The plan is... you go.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hold on.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Whatever. Sorry.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
I know. I love that.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Um... yeah but it's more...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
I guess.
About a year.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
He had to make a phone call.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Where?
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
No dad!
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
...I will.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
I heard.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What time is it?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Have they said anything about our area?
Yes.
Edgar, come inside.
Who wrote this book?
I just asked his name.
What's two?
Don't yell at her!
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
The footprints.
Pinned? What does that mean?
You're in here for winging a guy?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
It was my fault.
Did it seem short to you?
Sounds good.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Is he alive?
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
They've been kind to me.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
You got no idea what they were after?
Not for five years.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
He is that.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't have any family any more.
Good luck, Mal.
I heard that too.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
It is that.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
I run the place. What can I get you?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Who's the owner?
That's the good stuff.
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
I don't want you to get hurt.
That was my plan.
I wouldn't worry about that.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Please.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Even the fall from the plane.
I'll walk you out.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone you know is lying.
Viktor, you should have said something.
She said you were very beautiful.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Thank you.
Do what?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
When is she coming over?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
Why not?
I know what you mean.
I was misquoted.
What's that?
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
If anyone asks about Simone --
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Night, Lainey.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
It's a yacht.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Dark?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
My God, you've got one?
What do you want -- ?
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Goodnight, sweetheart.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
Look over there.
That I'm a freak.
Who me?
I forgot myself.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
What?
Never mind.
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes, I am.
I guess she did.
Maybe.
Really?
Yeah.
They did?
Cole, please stop.
Like what?
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
What's a "little while?"
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Bitch.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Not lately.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Bus broke down.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
People say he was a murderer.
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Nothing to tell.
Nah. Just you.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
You never had trouble communicating before.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Grant.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
We're coming your way, man!
Sorry.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
How many you need?
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
You're pretty.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
What other stuff?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
If...?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Driving?
Would I lie to you?
I give up.
We lost him.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Ciao.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
See.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Go.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Redneck heaven.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'll believe it when I see it.
We'll be waiting. Over.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Yeah, but...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Chickenshit money.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
...About what?
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
I got his machine.
Okay.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
What are you doing here?
-- will be handled back in --
...He does now...
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...So you made another deal?
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
I don't see it like that at all.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah... Sid?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
What?
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
Leave the light off.
A puppet.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
No, she won't.
He'll let me in.
Why, who did you see?
What was it?
My wife.
No.
She drank liquid oxygen.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Yes.
I love her.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
I'll go with you.
To calm your anxiety.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Sartorius.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Not this time.
He is.  But he was here...
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
Thank you.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Who are you, then?
I can't --
You must have been dreaming.
It's an experiment.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Hello, Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
No, Ma'am.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Sooner, the better.
And "is"...?
Tell it like it is.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Let go!
Oh God, that's great!
"To"... Forget about you.
You take care.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Sure we are, let's go!
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
I can still use a gun.
I might stop you.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I had to follow her to a store.
Did you hear what I said?!!
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What's the difference?
I just sat and listened.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
No, I need'm now!
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Does it make you... hard?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I know where everything is.
We're gonna pass the street.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
Remember Little League?
Oh, sure.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hm.  What a lump.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Harry…
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Don't be pitiful.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Get away from me, freak!
Right.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Mr. Jameson--
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Huh?
Thank God.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Hi, Adele.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Why?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Any sign of our friend?
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Aunt May, what happened?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Bonkers.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Looks good outside.
We'll get some more.
I don't know anymore.
Who is it?
Yeah. Security.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
That's right.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Take it.
We're looking at it.
Forget it.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
You are talking crazy!
Let's!
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Let me go!
Me? What if she don't want me?
Where'd that come from?
What do they always say?
Let me alone.
Why, sure!
You want to go?
Anything else?
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Just what makes you so popular?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Not particularly.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
A chicken?
Just don't drool on it.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
When is it expected back?
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
What happened to you?
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Yes, where would you go?
Oh, of course.
That's right.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
Phasing? To where?
I thought you might.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Nothing. As before.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
... Fascinating.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
I have already made one transmission too many...
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
You said there wouldn't be any.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Aye, sir!
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
You would have done the same for me.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Fire, Mr. Scott!
About a dozen officers and men.
Go, Sulu!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Any time.
But, why?
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Yes...
... Yes...
... Spock...
Success, my lord.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.


Good for you, Lieutenant.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
I saw it -- !
What's the matter -- ?
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Rake her.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Sensors, Captain?
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
He'll die -- !
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Yes, SIR.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Be careful, Jim...
Uhura, patch me in --
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Yes, sir.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Energize defense fields.
HURRY.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Erased...
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
At what.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir --
Ready, sir.
I exaggerated.
Fine. Just fine.
Gillian --
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Please...
A moment alone, please.
It'll come back to him.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
-- That's the general idea.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Come on, Pavel...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
Like what?
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
I suppose they told you that...?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
You've already been that. C'mon.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Just lucky, I guess.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
All right. The truth?
You want the details?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Right.
Kirk. They're gone.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
A spaceship with a missing man.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
... You have a point...
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
What is our target in time?
Surely you can be more specific...
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
How do you know this...?
The hell I can't
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Thank you, Spock.
I will, Admiral.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Picture, Uhura!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
On screen.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Millions?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
... an offlander?
I'll be here.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
Are they in any danger?
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Captain, Geordi...?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
How about a passive radiation scan?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Why not?
Eject the core.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
You've not aged a day since then?
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
No children?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Augh?
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
I look forward to reading your report.
Yes...
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
I do not know what you are referring to.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Great name. French?
You don't sound French.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
There's a few of us left.
The invasion plans.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes, he is.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
No. It's a lot further than that.
Steady as she goes.
Aye, sir.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
I'll keep that in mind.
Understood!
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
I wish I knew. Uhura?
We've been set up all along.
No way.  You see this?
If they're even looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
That's a comfort...
Well, I -
Your honors, the State rests.
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Do we report this, sir?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Kill him! He's the one!!
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Except us.
Possibly.
Candidate for what?
WHO ELSE...?
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Captain.
Sir?
Sulu!
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
An error.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
What's left of it.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Aye, aye, sir.
Yes, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
You are me.
Because you are dangerous.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
That was another time.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
Negative.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
And I you.
Make it so.
This isn't about me anymore.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Understood.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
On screen.
Aye, sir.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Counselor?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Praetor Shinzon?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Yes. The eyes have it.
How did you end up on Remus?
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Yes.
I know.
Why am I here?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
What's this all about?
And what of the Enterprise?
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
They will obey, Praetor.
I have a purpose.

We should have. Let me see.
Stay right there...
Elmo's...
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
When can we expect containment?
It's in a green Mustang?
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
Shermin...
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
This is George Fox...
Okay...
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Which way do you want to go?
Eh... police.
Yes.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
I am...
My... husband.
Horses.
Yes.
Yes. Day... night.
I need you.
No.
When we get here.
It was a mistake.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I understand.
He will.
I do not want to.
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I feel better if I move.
But...
What for?
I know how to gamble now.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I understand.
Many, many days and nights...
No, thank you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I must go.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
In the cars, too?!
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Wait'll you see it.
It could have been anything.
Yes.
You know that's impossible!
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
You're going down.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
What're you going to do?
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I just got to talk to you for one second.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
We should talk alone.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Thanks, Max.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He records himself raping and killing her--
Is he dead?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Only way I could stand your ties.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Yeah, but that was for love.
Fumitsu.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
No, sir.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
What's wrong with me?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
He had an orange hat on.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Another what?
From the grave?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
What I do requires confidentiality.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
"Was?"
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Does Koessler ask about me?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I...
Yes.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
Those were just fantasies.
You? You went by the book?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[What does the file say?]
Sounds like fun.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
You're money, baby.
What's that like?
Nikki.
Hi.
Anything.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...then ask where you met her...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Did you get it?
Could you believe it?
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Sorry?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...get the hell outta here already...
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
...the Michelin commercial...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
It sucks.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Oh no?
Classy.
I just tested for one...
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
It's unbelievable.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
You always know the right thing to say.
So, what? Eleven?
Damned if I know...
I can't believe you.
What are they doing here?
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
She's really special, guys.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
When?
I'm not going to Vegas.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
What?!?
Let's go.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
She smiled, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
No, baby. You're money.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
How?
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
What?
What a surprise.
No, baby!
No...
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...Is he brown?
No.
What was cold about it?
You think?
True.
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Our little baby's growing up...
I'll come to you when I need you.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Barzini.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
OK, but be careful.
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
Are you worried about security for your million?
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
And with prison record.
Should I bring him in.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Yes.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
You wanted me to be your son.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Yes.
You look good, too.
Mike!
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Mama, no.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
No.
How is your father?
OK. 
Wake me up when you come to bed?
How's Mom?
I can help you out...
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Maybe.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Just be patient.
He talked to you?
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
I don't like you.
Can you mix a martini?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I love jazz.
This is so good of you.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
Copy out from here...
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
I thought you'd missed the train.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
So tell me.
How?
Tom, I don't love you.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
So I'm learning.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Ha. Did he say why?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Marge, when did you get here?
I can explain.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't believe you.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
No glasses.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
As in the...?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I know.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
A ragione. A ragione. 
I can't later.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
No key, huh?
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Yes?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Of course. What happened to your face?
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Nah. I ain't interested.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Keep it.
You forgot "sexy".
With who?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
Ouch!
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
One-Ball McCall?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
You looking for some action?
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Oh, come off it, man.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Why, thank you Travis.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
How's your driving record?
Physical? Criminal?
Military record?
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Your name Sport?
Shit.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Hey Wizard.
Slow.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
I'm a field agent.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
It's all I could think of.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Delly?  In here.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yeah...
Yes.  Hic!
Nothing.  
Oh.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Exactly.  And he got good.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
A statement?
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Can't wait.
Ah.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Sandra Sinclair.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Thanks.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
She's very pretty.
Can we get him to the hospital?
What's his rent?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Cat.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Thanks.
The customers?  I don't know...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
Yes.  Very.
Yes?
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
Thank you.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
All right. 
A trifle.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
That's up to you.
Then go.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Just listen to them!
If your father were here...
No!
Take them.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I don't know, honey.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
It's Alice.
Yep.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
We'll make our own fog.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Yes, very.
Yes.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Shhh. Shhh.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
But they'll be back.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Did you close the door?
Not by the thousands.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
We met in court.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
Yes?
Look, Mr. Brenner...
Famished.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
You have a job?
What do you do?
Helping travelers.
What?
No, tell me.
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
No, thank you.
Hear, hear!
Take wing!
Mmm?
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
How soon?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
That would hardly be possible.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
I've heard of it.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Well? And are you not a good student?
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
You see, it is completely out of the question.
I can't believe that.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
You've no thought of going there?
Why, yes.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
A doctor?
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
Nearly a year.
Yes, Doctor.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
Yeah. I sure will.
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
Where the fuck did you come from?
I don't know you, man.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Someone else did it.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
Yeah, I know.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
It's what Lauren would do.
I know.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Not tonight. Honest.
Honey. I just can't.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
He said he'd prove it.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I leave that in your hands.
Yes.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Yes -- I think so.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
About 250 million of your miles.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I can judge only by what I see.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
I feel different right now.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
It won't work.
I'm sorry.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
That's right.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
He's my brother.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
They're gonna book us.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
For a ride.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
I can't do that!
Hit the lights again.
What?
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Lots more where he came from.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Whatcha doin' over here?
No.  Just you.
For what.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
I'm tired now.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
I thought we were poor.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Mom!
Lucy.
Hi, Thorn.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
I hear this is the decade for cute.
I hope so.
Me, too.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Take laddie.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
What would that make Mom?
Piss off.
I don't know.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Finish what?
I don't know who to trust.
Now who'd go and do...
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Look, I'm just guessing...
You buy any of this, Blair?
That's good enough.
Probably the next meal.
But...
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
What do you mean "you think so?"
Come on, Copper.
All in Norwegian.
I think so.
Thank you.
After all this mess.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Little over two hours.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Why?
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
The generator!
So what do you make of it?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
MacReady, that you?
What happened?
This is it?
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Yes.
I'm used to that.
Last night.
What?
It was meant to.
How do you control the Morlocks?
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
I'm a foolish man.
Because...
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
I mean... well... affection.
You know I can't.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Do you know you were humming?
Tonight's the night?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
Thank you.
Mm.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
You can see so many here.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
We share everything.
Thank you.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
How do you decide?
You know this?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Mara --
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Tell him to go away --
Exactly correct, sir.
Imagine that.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
No...
New Yorkers.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Then don't.
What about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
He didn't either.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
Well, you belong in one.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
Yeah.
After I...
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I know.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
You think Lorenson kills you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
They're not.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
It's Sunday.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
Ok.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
Believe me, I know.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
I'll die either way.
Well, what time is it?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Because I don't have time.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Is it true?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
No.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Sure.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
You want to come on in?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
What's wrong?
What for?
Shut up.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Christ, sure... yes!
Not yet.
Call me back.
Peaches.
It's nothin' like that.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Which part?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Yes.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Yes!  I believe I am!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now what what?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Yeah.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Just ignore him.
Thelma!
About how fast was I going?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
I believe you.
Yes.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
You're drivin'.
What?
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You too, sweetie, the best.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
How do you stay so positive?
All this for us?
Fuck you.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Good-looking?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Uh-huh.
Yeah feels like it.
Mints?
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
'That right?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Who the fuck is it to you?
You found my car?!
Dumbshit.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
I beg your pardon?
-- He's in a cage?!
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Deco.
That...? Vestibule.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Forget it. It was... fun.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Who the hell's Woogie?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
So she hasn't changed?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Do what?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
How'd you manage that one?
Nice.
You were following us?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
'That right? Good for you.
No I'm not.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Where's Puffy?
Where would I have seen your work?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
You betcha!
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Oh great, I ran out.
What are you?
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
I wish.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
No, that's really unneces --
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
What --
Yes.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
What does the letter say?
Cuba.
Says what, Kenny?
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Dean Rusk!
I, uh...
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Yeah, a good political solution.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Rug samples.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Good. Thank you.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
That's right.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
When did we get that?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Yes.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Why should I tell you.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
What do you mean?
Sorry.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
So they took care of Leo.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
I read, Cooch.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
How the hell do you know?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
I could be, too.
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
I saw one.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
I was inverted.
You know. The finger.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Too aggressive?
What are you talking about?
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Used to what?
It's not suffering anymore.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
And now?
Anything.
. Yeah!
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
What?
I was flying...my responsibility.
It does.
That's up to you.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
...Something like that.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
He better be kidding!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
NO. NO GOOD.
Not anymore.
BREAKING LEFT!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Yawing right.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
You go. I'm staying with it.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Who's your pilot?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Let's go. Eject.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Don't.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
That's because you don't have any women.
GOT 'EM.
SHIT!!
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Sir?
All right.
No bother.
Or....
I know.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
And you get a kickback.
Take me to the hotel.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
But maybe you can change all that.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
It's about goddamn time.
What is it?
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Come on...put his head in place.
Sleazy...and demure.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Swallow this.
Where?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Relax, you'll live longer.
Where's Kuato?
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Rekall?
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Up to the right.
I've got Quaid.
Level 2.  Galleria.
What the hell is this?
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Nobody.
I don't know.
Just think about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
All right, forget about it.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
It was implanted by the Agency.
I'm honored.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Bullshit.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Jump!
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
You can't fight'em that way...
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Well, who put you two in charge?
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Adios, bridge!
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
The rifle.
Right.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Civil?  I'm civil.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
An hour after you picked it up!
He was your snitch.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Correct.
I have to talk to your brother.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
We had a description of the suspect.
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Right. You're right.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
That's why I hate experts.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
What's Art Esparza?
Neither.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
"Painted"?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You tell me, man.
It was self-defense.
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Y-yes, sir.
Don Reynard.
Shu Kai Kim.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Badgering.
Objection.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
-- Eddie told you?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Soldado.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Here he comes.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Thank you, Carl.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Tell me about the letter.
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
You are here and there is no place to go...
What happened to her?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Faulty wiring.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Donna, are you my best friend?
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
If I can smoke it.
No, you're the muffin.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Cause I like it.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Maybe.
No... No...
I'm not.
I am The Muffin.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Everything, but everything.
Sex?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Fish eyes?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom, take it easy.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Fine.
A friend from school.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
We're late to get to your mother.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
As if I didn't know.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes. It would be.
It looks that way.
It's a crime.
Yes.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
No.
Through, through his book.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
Objection.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Huh!
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
...We did everything we could...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
That's what I'd planned to...
...I made a reservation at...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
I understand.
How old is he?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
Yes.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
What?
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
I think I will.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Isn't there something you...
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I know. I went...
Yes.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
The broad has disappeared...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
In New York?
Huh.
All right - I've seen enough!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
But I think I know where she'll be....
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Would you like some coffee, General?
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
What?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
No.
No...
Oh my God...
Everything is not fine!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You have a fever, sweetie?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
Bye.
I like this story.
Say how they find their way back home.
They were safe and could sleep.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Listen, dammit.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Not yet.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
What do you mean?
Yes sir.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Gieg, Chuck.
Whatever.
To take a piss.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
I just can't believe it.
Because it looks good.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
We all have problems.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Yes.
Fine.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
And, of course, we are.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
It has nothing to do with him.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
I couldn't do it.
Outer.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
Sir.
I'm sorry...
What makes you so sure it was one?
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Why? He's right in the groove.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Yessir.
Ready for another?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
What's the name of it?
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
See ya downstairs.
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Didn't he say somethin'?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
What's that, peanut?
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You do.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Yeah.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Under a hundred.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
Yeah, I'm here.
If you say so.
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
You think she's gonna make it?
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Oughta make 'em happy.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Lead the way.
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
What time's Sailor's train get in?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos...
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Well?...
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
She's a transvestite.
She's still a transvestite.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I thought you were tinkering.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He heard everything we were saying.
Just go around him.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Shit.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
What's to tell?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
...we find the jacket.
It's mine.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
A little.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
You're welcome.
Blocked.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Your aunt?
Maybe...
Glaucoma?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Because of my coat?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
No thanks.
When nobody's looking.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Grady!
Who does?
I got the message you called too.
All right. This morning --
Simple.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Really? That was fast.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Would Walter really press charges?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Dozens. It's very sad.
I told Walter.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
I... I...
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
I was thinking of you.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
That's weird.
I might have his number on campus.
I haven't heard of half of those.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Something wrong with that?
How is she?
When can I see her?
How old is Anna?
Huh?
Yeah. It's really nice.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
It's hard to describe.
Cop.
Have a seat.
I have no idea.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Know what?
I could take you downtown.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
I'm adjusting okay.
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
How come?
Yes?
What will happen if I do?
The job's okay.
How's that?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
Is this the first one?
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
I don't know.
I don't see --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
All right.
This is garbage!
Yes.
I feel... okay.
I'm all right.
What?
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
Yeah, they could.
What?
I suffer from insomnia.
Hi.
What?
Nothing. It's over.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
No you don't.
Just think about it.
Who doesn't?
Where're you?
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
What do you think he saw?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
You noticed.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Yuh?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
How deep?
Wait for what?
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
At what?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
And how do you explain that?
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, maybe that is better.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
And what about you?
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
So, you wonder why?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Better dead.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
To do what?
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
What do you mean by sensible?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Unfortunately, no.
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Is that possible?
Through someone else?
Why?
Who told you this?
Agnes...
Oh my dear child.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Yes, Mother.
I don't know... I don't know...
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Anything... may I sit down?
Is that where they say it came from... ?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Then let's talk about something else...
Would you like to ask them?
Not at the moment, no.
I've stopped menstruating
Somebody told her.
No.
No.
Yes.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Everything... I don't have children.
Yes.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Of what?
No.
What do you do?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
What did she mean?
Yes.
Agnes... Agnes...
Who?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Marty, what are you doing here?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Who told you this?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Two packs a day.
Unfiltered.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Obviously there was.
The science of psychiatry.
That's ridiculous...
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
There's another choice.
What is it?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Bullshit!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
All right?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Become?  One is born a saint.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
My God, you're as crazy as...
How  ?
You're saying God did it?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
Where is she?
Yes.
That's a lie.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Shurrup!
Are you now?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
I'm a deserter, too.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I've made the scene.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
No, straight up.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
He hasn't.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
And cunning.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Books are good!
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
I'm not wrong.
Lip reading.
Nothing good.
Is there a fire, then?
What's he on about?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Here, Pauly.
For Ringo.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Like what?
Foreign devil ...
So's mine.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Oink! Oink!
Hi, our lot!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
I'm not, no.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Oh, leave off!!!
Well ...
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Someone put it on me.
But...
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Nerves.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
A proper Aborigine.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
... I don't know...
Dell, plot our location.
Receiving.
What is it, I can't --
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
Unknown.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
It grows on you.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
No, I don't want us separated.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Ask him.
How's Broussard?
Still unconscious?
Can you do anything for him?
Good.
Don't be an idiot.
At least it can't get up here now.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I think it's fizzled out.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Turn on navigation lights.
Good!  Moisture content?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
What killed it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Is that its mouth?
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
I guess we open the door and net it.
Let's be democratic.
By eating our food supplies.
... More spores coming.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Sure.
Yeah...
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
What's happening?
Get her on-line.  Now!
No, but I got something that might interest you.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Do it.
I dunno.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
How?
It's alright, it's cool...
Uh-huh.
How tight are these shafts?
Well... try the headset.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Don't wait for me!
I... I can't!
What time's sundown?
Phoebe.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Yes. I do.
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
I never intended you to be.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
You were there? At the play - last night?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
And cut that out right now.
As of this moment you're six years old...
When - when are you coming back?
Sing it?
I love you...
I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many interests.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
What's all over?
Gone.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Don't calm down.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Here we go...
I've been aware of that for some time.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
Hear, hear...
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just asked a simple question.
You didn't have to tell me.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
Everything.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Of course!
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
See you home...
Oh-oh.
Like an agent with one client.
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Don't be dense. The party.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
How did you get in here?
You were just looking around...
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Oh, no...
My husband...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't intend to be.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I'll never get over it.
Of course it is.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I had no idea you knew each other.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Really, Eve? Why?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
About what?
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Eve?
I wonder why.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
They'd die without each other.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
... Among so many quiet qualities.
What is he talking about?
Where is she?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
What's your being married got to do with it?
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
I was sure trying.
The fucking New York Times.
--see?--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
When?
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I haven't said anything--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Who?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Any idea what he did?
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--so?
--that was awhile ago--
And?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
Who were they?
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
Electronic surveillance.
--I'm not here.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I have nothing more to say.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
No.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Anyone but Bernstein.
--go over your sources again--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
Of course--everything they asked--
I'm not Miss Abbott.
-- Thanks, coach --
Single malt?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
Of course, I didn't --
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Neither will I.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Sure.
I'm not playing.
What's that?
I know, it sucks!
Yeah right.
Did you guys hook up or something?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Highly, highly overrated.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
C-Span?
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
You've got something going?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Well...uh...
For me?
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Me too.
Yeah, right here.
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Observe.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Shut the fuck up.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Yep.
Doing what?
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Just like sex with my wife.
But you better hurry.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
AHHHHHHH!
No it isn't! You're dead!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
It's okay. I can see fine.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
Andy! No!
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
You'll never get the chance.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
And you call me a moron...
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
What?!
Oh shit... No...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
What about me?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Andy? Andy is that you?
Sort of...
That's McDermott, but yeah.
How well did, er, do you know him?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Double merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
When you're older . . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Who's Sophie?
What happened to your parents?
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Trying... to... breathe...
Now just get off the train.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Anya... where are we?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Yes, you do. You do.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
He's her?
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
Run, Anya -  go...
Young	man, I...
I should go
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Come on.
You don't want my autograph.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Alvy.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
No, Chippewa Falls.
Wisconsin.
Okay, that's good.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Oh, yeah.
Neat, yeah.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
I have a tiny apartment.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
Well, have you ever made love high?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
U-huh.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Yeah?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oh. What?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh! My God! 
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Yeah.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Yeah.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
...as opposed to a print...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
V.P.L.?
His wife has diabetes!
SO?
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
You think so? Do you really?
...of possibly working together.
Yeah.
I was a great beauty.
I was very charming.
Oh yes.
It's the way they do things.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Why didn't you come in?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
Leo?
October-ish.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
Really.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Yeah.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
Lucy overdosed.
She's in ICU.
Excuse me?
Forget it, Judy.
Hey!  Would you?
We've only been over this how many times?
Well, you're a tower of support.
Did you invite them?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Truce?
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Well he can't have gone far.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Don't do this.
You changed your mind.
Will you make love with me?
Don't be silly.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
I meant Sally.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I will treasure this.
Lemon.
I'm sorry.
And he doesn't smoke?
How long have you been married?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
God willing.
Are you working on a new book?
How long ago was it?
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
Yes.
Oh?
Oh?
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Yeah.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
You don't know she's a bitch.
Like your business managers?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
I never like to talk about my work.
No.  Not something new.
You don't need to thank me.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Would you like to meet my husband?
I thought it was okay where it was.
A notch above the storage room.
So how much do you hate her?
Not nice.  Not kind.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
<u>What</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Divinely?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You did?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Mom!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Duty calls!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
...Ants...
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
What do I do?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Oh!
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
What time does the show go on?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How many of those drinks did you have?
I thought so.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Let me help you.
You don't want me here --
Someone from the office.
I mean -- her apartment.
Miss. 
As soon as I can walk.
No -- it's my stomach.
They had to pump it out.
Give what up?
Pick a card.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You really think so?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Who'd care?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Over a girl?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
You usually eat alone?
The dishes?
What?
Oh.
That's very wise.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
That's right, Baxter.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
You too, sir.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Sir?
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Mine?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
What does he mean, accident?
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Happy New Year.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Not particularly.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
I wasn't trying.
Handle what?
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
All set for what?
Atlantic City?
Baxter?
Sssssh.
Don't you ever stop talking?
I told you -- with my mother.
What gives?
Go where?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
I said I like all of them.
Esprit de corps --
One for all -- all for one --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
No shit.
Yeah, it is.
God knows.
Not a thing.
... he's an amazing officer.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
Who knows what's up there?
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Which way? Right or left?
We ain't goin' down the river.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Haiphong.
I met him.
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
You know you're right.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You can't have water after morphine.
I can handle it.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes, I know...
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Nah.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
His name is...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
23   CONTINUED:  
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
94   CONTINUED:  
I just want this over with.
157  CONTINUED:
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'll tell you everything later.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Forget it.  It would take days.
I'm here to do my job.
Yeah?
You don't get it, do you?
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
You got one?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
No, I better stay at my post.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Nothing personal.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Huh?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
I love you.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Emergency room only.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
How old are you?
You all set here?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
You take off when you have to.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Never.
To hell with sex.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Yeah... Well...
Go ahead.
What a break...
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Good night.
All right, cut me a break.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
Don't want to. I love you.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Two years ago...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
He's a pain in the ass.
Okay by me.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Think white and get serious.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Ask him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Maybe this can wait.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Where are all your queer party friends?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Oh, my gosh.
Got any easier questions?
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
You consider your life easy.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
What?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Tachlinkov.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
Oh, yeah.
Why don't you tell me.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
What?
Do you want Rath or not?
Sick.  The flu.
Know what?
The contract?
Robert?  Robert?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Turn off the engine.
Until a minute ago.
Another contractor.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Just Electra?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
How old were you?
Jesus -- why?
Why not?
Why not?
Why?
Are they usually like that?
No.  Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
Where is it?
Thinking.
Oh.  What do you think about?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
For Nicholai?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I'm sure you will.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
No.
Okay.
Yes.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Everyone regrets something.
Sometimes.
A dime.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Care to elaborate?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No....The Asylum!
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Is it gone four-thirty?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
No beer?
No, not yet.
What?
No, the boyfriend.
It just happened.
What?
So I hear.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Lucky break!
Did you see anything in the files?
Siberia.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Some deal you did there!
No, by road?
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That one?
Yes.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Great....How long will it go for?
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Good, great....Dobchay!
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Sure!
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Maybe it is!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Why?
It's time to go home, Holly.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Go to hell!
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Very well.
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
And I have no idea why.
That's over. Way over.
I could take after Dad, too.
I didn't know either.
Landon --
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
I need to whizz.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Scamming's a strong word.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
-- This your idea of small talk?
Were?
I don't want to have any conversation.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
So you agree you need help?
Go for it.
And you have to meet my father.
Know so.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
You don't miss a thing.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
That sounds like horseshit.
You don't know what you want --
When I have something to say.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
I have to get you home by one.
No.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Where?
I'm sick.
I will.
Tired.
Yes.
Up to?
No.
I have expectations, too.
No. I want what's best for you.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Lead man.
I don't want to see her hurt.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I'm no dummy.
I'd do that --
Then you remember more than I do.
Where did you get -- ?
I didn't say you did.
Thank you.
Fine.
Oh yeah.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
You do?
No!
How are you?
Learn anything?
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Why?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What?
Five cents, please.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
You know me?
The power converter...
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
That's just great!
You were ringing the doorbell!
You did what?!?
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Jesus!
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
The Orpheum.
Sure,.
Dick? Dick who?
Well, he's gone.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Yeah.
Not bad.
No, he showed me one.
Yeah.
They're okay.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Tom...
What'd you come out here for?
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
What?
Sure.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Okay.
Yeah.
How bad off is he?
You said that once already... Too late now.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Positive?
I'm serious.
It was going too fast.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Stay as long as you like.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Hold it right there.
New Jersey?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
What is it, Tommy?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Everybody okay up here?
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was killed, Penny.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
It's too dangerous.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
No!  Ditto the professor-
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Really?...
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Hah!
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
And what would that be, son?
Are you all right?
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
He's a great writer –
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Yes... Isn't it?
Okay... a quick one, sure...
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Where there's life there's hope.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
You gotta believe me –
We gotta call the police –
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Lou.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Huh?
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Excellent picture.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
She said what you said she'd say.
I thought you quit.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
Tell me about Catherine.
Put your hands up!
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I have nothing to hide.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know all about me.
No.  Come in.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Didn't you study it in school?
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Don't get too cocky.
What's it about?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I don't have a choice.
Try me.
I don't know.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What happens to them?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
He was murdered.
Why would I need an attorney?
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Were there ever any suspects?
Do you remember his name?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I hope I helped you out.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Somethin', though.
I went over last night, too.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
I don't believe it.
What do you want?
Is he dead?
I'm sure.
She killed him.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
No. Should I have?
I don't know.
Not sure. How was yours?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
I think it's in New Jersey.
Ignorant art?
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I don't like beer.
You should talk to him about this.
How about right now?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
What?
You're not?
Who said that?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Chateau Latour '64, please.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Still not here.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
SAMO.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Come on in!
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
I guess you did.
Can I walk you home?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
How is he?
George?
Yeah, it's the best one.
It's three thousand dollars!
Have a Mac.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
No, actually I feel worse.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Hanging on every word.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Maybe you're right.
Have we?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Nope, I told her everything.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Too good?
Actually, it's a lot like that.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
You'd be surprised.
Alfred's happy here.
Divide and conquer.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I'm afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Can he save her?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
I knew you could handle it.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
I've got to stop him.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
The _Rolls_?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
Dr. Meridian...
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Perhaps the fall...
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Mystery.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Slanta.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Not much.
That's usually my line.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
How could I forget?
What the hell is going on here?
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
You're a genius.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... Looks like a convention.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
... Where are you calling from?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
What are you talking about?
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
... Behind the makeup?
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
What were you thinking?
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
He's not crazy.
It's gone.
I said I'd check with you.
Meaning?
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Night.
oh dear.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Certainly is.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
And a car.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Great, good.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
What's your problem Beavis?
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Uh... Uh...
Me first?
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
My butt's bothering me!
Heh hmm heh heh.
Uh...
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yer late.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Oh, that's nice.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
I see it. I don't get it.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Where are his pants?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
We're rich in what really matters.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I am sitting.
That's how long you were gone.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That's my girl!
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Three times.  Powerful number.
I didn't --
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Really.  I don't know.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
We tried.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
No.  You don't want his help.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No, wait!
Are you a spirit too?
Yeah.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
That's it!
Just <u>say</u> it.

Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Stepmother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
I cannot believe this.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Any particular kind?
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
I thought I saw something.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Maybe Charles does.
Look at the tiny figures.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Why not?
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
But not for long...
No, Robert.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
... But he's...?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I agree.
Yes. Thank you.
No. I'm a gardener.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Yes.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
That's good.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Our greenhouse.
I see.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Yes. That could be true.
Thank you.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
I don't want Robert.
I agree.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
I certainly do.
... I see.
I agree.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
A flower...
I can't read.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
I agree.
Of course. I would like to look.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Which view?
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
I live here.
No.
No, I do not have any of those.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
But you won't sign, correct?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Hello, Sophie.
No, that won't do any good.
It's not that, I just...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Good. Anything else?
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
May 11th.
Yeah. You want a beer?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
You've always loved the animals.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Shut up!
I love you so much.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
I said "yes."
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
I wouldn't know.
The usual, Barry.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
Yikes.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
What's he been in?
Sure. It'd be fun.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
You're evil, Maxine.
Hush, sweetheart.
Can I be anyone I want?
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
I have to see you.
One hour.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Mr. Malkovich?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Oh, Lotte...
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
I likes yellow.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
May I come in?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Yes ma'am..
Extra?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama?
Oh I been out.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
I don't want to know.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Shit.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
That is for the urn.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
I am the Walrus.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Uh-huh.
No--
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
In the briefcase?
And what do you do, sir?
Separate incidents?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Delayed after-eff--
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Am I wrong!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
MARK IT ZERO!
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
The nail polish, Walter.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Now Dude--
Nihilists!  Jesus.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Look, man, did you--
Dude?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
What's your point, Dude?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
Come on, Walter!.
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
You're a fuck, Walter!
...Us? DUDE
Did I urinate on your rug?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Walter!
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
Impressive.
Someday.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
I'll heal.
Fry 'em.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
Why?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I want to see the sun rise.
Either that or feeding the worms.
I'll show you.
Then who does he work for?
Too bad you're out of it.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're blind --
Who is LaMagra?
You're joking --
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
He didn't. Get over it.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Blade --
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
You're a week early.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
What about the chemistry panel?
No problem.
Sometimes --
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
You've been listening in the whole time?
Go on, I'll be fine!
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
So whoever built this--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
What is <u>this</u>?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
You don't want it though.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--Cotter's--
What?
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
I know, I know.
I want amphetamines.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
--go!
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--Cotter: shut up.
Too busy eating us?
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<u>What</u>--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--Graduate Thesis--
--now there.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
--I dunno, I just woke up--
--oh, Jesus--
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
One of the printers.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
At least you still have the tapes.
What?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Shoot.
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
--it's urgent!
--the Sheriff's Office--
What happened to my Dad??
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Meurice--
Yeah.
I just gotta see a guy.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I couldn't believe it either...
...Mm-hmm.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
What the hell happened, Ray?
In the trunk.
I think someone's watching.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
No. It just made them feel better.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
For the money.
I want you to go fishing.
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
Got something to show me first?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
What.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
What?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
Yes.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey.
I wanted to see you.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
Yes, I like you.
What?
Don't say that.
Who's it, you mean.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Frank is coming?
What do you want?
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
No. it's not Don.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Am I bothering you?
Terrible. boring.
Where are they?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
I'll drink to that.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Okay, Sandy.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Where to?
Let's wait for some slow one.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Hey Jeff.
Be right down.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Do you want the car?
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I'll get a coat for her.
You can change it if you want to.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
You happy, baby?
Derek!
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
You're a fucking amateur!
We want some grass.
No.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Okay.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Just a friend.
Try the closet.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
You fucked me, Diego.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Mom.
Un sapo?
It's beautiful.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
And Diego?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Out.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Kristina's fine.
You can call me Dad if you want.
You mean, like a trip?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
You swear?
I don't believe you.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
So, we need to get to the source.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
That's right.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
Sid Ahmed.
Sail.
Second district ...
It's true.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Good evening, sir.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Of course I am.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
Cause?
What'd he die of?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
You get his statement?
A little after eleven.
I had some papers to pick up.
No -- never.
Yes.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Yes.
I had bypass surgery.
What did she say?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.
That's all Dr. Paley.
That's enough.
No.
Chinese peony root.
We dated for about a month last year.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
Yes.
No.
Then you would have gotten your money?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
We're not animals.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
Sure.  Where to?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What?
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
Of course.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
Shoot him.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Roston?
How often do you use cocaine?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yes.
I'll talk to him later.
We have to talk.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
No.
It was a place to start.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I know. I don't understand it either.
No treasure maps, huh?
Come here a minute.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Oh, that'll be nice.
How long you been married?
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Not at all.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Why?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
You get used to it.
What?
Yes.
No.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Wonderful. Uh...
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I want you to come.
Yes, that'd be nice.
Nobody's asking you to.
I sat outside and had coffee.
Because I already tried once.
What?
Yes, thanks.
What?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm going to miss you.
What's she like?
WHAT!
Yeah?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Just some flies.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
All the more reason I should be here.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Who?
I manage them.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill!  Bill?!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
It was just like in my head.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
No thanks.
What we have to do is call the police.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You want to get into this now?
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
This is insane!
The hell I can't!
Caesar, this is crazy.
Everything you couldn't.
I had to.  You made me.
Shut up!
Yes, I understand.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Why?
What?  They ain't there?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Where in the hell is he?
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
This is the police, ma'am.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
He said you lost something.
What do you want?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Basically.
Nothing.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What was it then?
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Mickey?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
To let it dry.
Does the case lock?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Trust me, Violet.
Not Caesar.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
What happened?
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Violet?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
...which one are you?...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
We have to go home, Jason.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Okay.
Get the fuck away from my car.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
Then I'll find another ride.
I know that.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
That's it?  Is that it?
...omigod, no...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx
-- here we go -- I found it --
What?
xxxxxx
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
No.
I don't know.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
... have a look.
...Yer nostril?
... ere please.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Well ... well, I ...
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Even later.
Er, I knew you looked different.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
You got the wrong man.
You killed him?
I'm sure you have
Very smart.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
You're the only person I can trust.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
I do. Goodbye. 
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
What?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
If you say so.
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
What parcel?
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Where are you going?
Don't do anything silly.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
What?
I delivered it.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
You're not listening, mother.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Fixed?
What is it?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
But ... I called Central Services.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
No ...
Pregnant.
You can trust me on this one.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
No.
He's going to be all right, right?
What's his name?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
Yeah?
Oh man, Bucky.
I know him. That's Noel.
I guess there's always a chance.
Yes.
He's working a double shift.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
How is she?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Maybe I should come up with you.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
She's no whore, Marcus.
That's too many.
What look?
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I quit! I'm through!
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
He was tough. You did all you could.
What do you want to break?
Frank!
You're burned out.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Faster!
You sure?
One more time!
Nice, Jane.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What's wrong with it?
It's not loaded.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Call if you get weird.
Eleven and a half.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
They're not that dumb, after all.
As good as humanly possible.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
I'm not kidding.
This is important to me.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Really?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
So I quit.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Yes, there is.
Yes.
Yes?
Bad manners.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Nobody else had it.
That's okay.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Fill for a second.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I like "godsend."
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Okay.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
What?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
That's yes?
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
You want to come?
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Right back to you.
Through the closet.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
What, right now?
Oh it's enough...
I'll pose any way you want.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
A thing I made.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Murdered man.
Me too.
Carla...
There there...
Walter!  Jeez!
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
That means you like me!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Just about anything, Walter.
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Leonard, what are you doing?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Why not?
I know, man.
I know, man.
Yeah, right outside the door!
What is it, your laundry?
I said I did, didn't I!
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well...
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
What, Mr. De Santis?
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
It was.
Just wait till you see this!
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Walter shut up and relax!
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Why not?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Gee.  Thanks.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Suck!
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I mean it.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yeah, I guess.
Hi, guys.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
You were having a nightmare.
Jealous?
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I thought we were meeting here.
No...
I am so sure.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
What for?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I'm glad you came.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
) What do you think?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Yeah, whoops I came.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I'm looking for you, actually.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Yes.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In Virginia.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
All right.
We'll cover it later.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
They were vampires?
Don't start with me again.
I...
Five.
As for example, what?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
And where are they now?
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Thanks.
Hi.
Oh.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
But --
Throw it out.
Okay.
Buffy?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Wit-tay.
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like you've got a grip.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Run.
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Switch nostrils?
A little better.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Nuke?!
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
--but you're father's in there!
That's great!
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
I can do that, too.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Which one of us?
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
Never heard of 'em.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You missed him!
You're a cocksucker!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Annie's a smart lady.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Boring.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
You fuck!
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
Forget it.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
Crash, shut the door.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Can I give you my testimony?
It's a league record.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
Liar.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Yes, you were.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
I'm serious. No interference.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
All right, take care.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
702 472 1862.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
Between...
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
What people?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
It's me.
Well...
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
I'll come by.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Certainly.  Senator.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Ginger's mission in life was money.
See you, Ginger.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Thank you.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
It's nice isn't it?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
But as much as they loved her...
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
I gotta tell ya...
Pretty serious.
He needed some clothes.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
What did Jennifer have?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
What if he won't stop?
I can back him off.
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
That's amazing.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
I really think you're -
A record of the arrests...
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can't do it with both hands?
So, you're a righty?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Mm.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Hey.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
I understand.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
I can't.
Hey!
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Nicky, I did -
I did - I didn't -
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He's gone?
I'm over here now.
I'll tell him, Remo.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
No problem.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Ma che cazzo!
I'll be right out.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
All right?
You're so nice. 
Yeah.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Okay.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Is that what you want?
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Okay?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
You are.
Promise?
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
'Go! Go! Go!'
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
You're driving me nuts!
Are they out now?
Get up.
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
So are we.
Let's get out of here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
No, no, no, no!
Charlie M.
Hey.
You sure?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I'm sorry.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
You are right. What can I...
Then do it the way you want.
Yeah.
It's okay. Let her go.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
You're probably right.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
I'm sure.
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
We'll hunt him down together...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
"Well done," Cactus.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
I got her...
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Stop.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
But of course you are.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
But I'm blind.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
You going to talk all day?
Where do you think you're going?
Don't you have children?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Theo wants to talk again.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Will you let me explain!
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
What about the others?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Sometimes I paint.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
A price on everything.
That's not her.
I'm trying to.
What do you mean?
Even if you found us -- what then?
Don't say that.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
No.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Are you okay?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You could've hit me.
You wouldn't --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
259-7881.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Who is this?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Some loyalty.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I wish it had never been invented.
It's your call.
Just relax.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
The fuck I will!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Hold on.
Thanks.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Persistent.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Did I?
You heard me --
Cunt.
Please, Dil --
She's not that either.
What?
It's a simple question.
In a way.
No.
Jimmy?
You can't leave me then, can you?
Where?
What look?
They're jealous.
Must be.
How special?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Yes, please.
Did you do that to him?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
I am.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Want to look after you.
Yeah.
I have to talk to her, Col --
What you doing here?
Don't call me that.
You mean that?
Sorry.
Are you pretending yet?
Don't be cruel.
You could say that.
Yes.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
No! I'm going home...
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Don't go like that.
You knew which man?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
No.
I suppose I tried.
I like you, DIl
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
The Metro.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
He's hot.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Och, you do, Fergie.
And what happens then?
Yes?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Thanks.
Peter.
Would make me feel better about it.
Who'd you think it was?
I understand.
Just a girl.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Yeah.
So, what do I look like?
No. It's the truth.
So I've noticed.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
And you know the funny thing?
No.
What?
Don't I know it.
What the fuck were you doing here?
Best game in the world.
How different?
Shut up, would you?
Yeah?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Don't be so sure.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Like what?
We got simple tastes, you and me.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
No.
You didn't?
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Nice lady.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
You're crazy --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
What about it?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
It's all right -- look.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
How do you think I got here?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
I'm through listening to you!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Reggie -- listen to me --
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
You mean spies and things like that?
May I have a sandwich, please?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Because they're still here.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
No.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Agents.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Very good.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I said with the mouth shut.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Reggie?
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Reggie -- listen to me --
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
There, you said it.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay.
I think I love you, Alex --
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm scared.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
It's a start, anyway.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
What do you mean?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
How much is it worth?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
Not unless we're blind.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Leave?
I'm very confused.
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I wish you wouldn't.
We won! We won!
No, Jean-Louis.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Lay on, MacDuff.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
Where?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Please stop -- please!
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
The American Embassy.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
He took care of Charlie for us.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
We want that money -- now!
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
As fucking if.
Not my imports.
So?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
That's impossible.
Daddy you scared me!
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
What's wrong?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No?
Are you sure?
She's still a virgin.
This will relax her.
You know where I can find her?
What are you doing here?
I'm sure you should have failed.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Really?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Why?
I was desperate. It was gross.
He says he loves me.
Ok.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
What?
I'm fine.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I'll think about it.
Yeah.
This party is sick.
Pretend we're just another couple.
That's what he said.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
How could you?
The word is Mob.
Hi Sandy.
But you don't really mean it.
What?

Take it easy, Jake.
'Course you do, Jake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Honest?
Maybe.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Summer colds are the worst.
Who?
Oh yes.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
What pictures?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Shut up.  Go on.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Yeah.
I guess not.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Well yes.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
...Just a minute...
A check?
I have?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
Did you have affairs?
Where you were when your husband died.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Oh.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
The Valley?
Is that unusual?
They can't be.
Why?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Why?
What were you doing there?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
It has to do with my father.
You didn't tell me.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Including the death of your husband?
You bastard.
You mean she just found out?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
What the hell is this all about?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
What are you saying?
Where can we go?
With us.
I'm all right.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
When did you come in?
Oh no.
Ida Sessions.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yes...
Yes...
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Yes. No.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Well, you never know, do you?
But you don't have any kids!!!
Toto, come here.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Too bad!
Yes. 
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No...
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Where is he?
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Oh!
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
That's a long story.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Charlie?!
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Certainly not.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Are they standing for me?
There is no news big enough.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's Leland, isn't it?
Has he said when he'll finish?
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Charles.
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
On the chiffonier.  Here.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
Oh, me -
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
You can't stop me.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir -
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
It's been a tough day.
Yes?
Good.
Charlie -
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
She's going to leave you -
Are you finished?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
I know you will.
Yes.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
That's the train with all the lights.
Sure.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Good!
Queer?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Rosebud?
Am I sure?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
Can I watch?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
There's no light back there.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I feel nauseous.
I can't believe you're here.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
There's more, isn't there?
But can we date?
We did.
Excuse me?
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Annoying Customer.
Peptic ulcer.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
No, thanks.
What do you two fight about?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Eight and a half?
She called you Brad?
What do you mean?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Return of the Jedi.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Basically.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Can we talk about this later?
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
What?
I know.
Sorry.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Can we not talk about this?
We're not playing in the street.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
An embarrassing way to die.
I swear.
Why should I loan you my car?
If you must.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Because I'm happy.
I'm happy.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Thanks.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Same time. What about you?
Jesus Christ, what next?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Nothing personal.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
Veronica.
Meaning?
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Bunch of savages in this town.
She called you, didn't she?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Something wrong?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many what?
Three.
I'm not the pig you are.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
Um. Thirty-seven.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Thank you for the lasagne.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
How yo doin', Gabe!
Fuck you.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Look, I know--
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Not on that leg.
Hi, Gabe.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
One...
That's it, you look like a professional.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He can handle it.
What are you doing here!?
You attacked me.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Up ahead.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Jess, c'mon...
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
There, what's that place?
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Kill him when he gets down.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Good morning, Walt.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Won't you join me, sir?
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
How do you do, sir?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Alex.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Well - I'm back.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
We're going to friends now, sir.
But it was horrible.
Fine. Fine.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Four in this block, sir.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You got a deal.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
When was the last time you took one?
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Of course.
Can't say that I do.
Can you finish on schedule?
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
No harm done, ma'am.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Let's not get excited, sir.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four minutes.
You mean like benefits?
It's not that kind of job.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Two, two-fifty.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Two...
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Tonight it is.
What'd he do to you?
Who was he?
How?
Believe it.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I never learned jazz.
Leave me alone.
She's in the hospital.
Jazz.
I'm sorry.
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
I don't know.
What's at Union Station?
One more.
That's what you said...
What happened to you?
Slow down.
Vincent?
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Who?
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Nothing is easy.
I have no idea.
Surprise me.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Never heard of him.
Uh huh.
You watch me, don't you?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Jerry, I --
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
What's in Connecticut?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
He gave it to me.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
They'll trace it.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Without a love of my own.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Could you be a little more specific?
I'm not sure what you mean.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I'm leaning toward no.
A dog bit it.
We're very specialized.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Working.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Not today...
This doesn't make sense.
What the hell does that mean?
Tell me about it.
I was just thinking that.
Wasn't my idea.
And Jonas?
Yes, sir.
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
So?
You're --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
Ellie.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Put it on speakers.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Because I can't.
That's my scientist.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
No.  Please.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
A page-break signal.  A period.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
-- of Hadden Industries.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
That's what they all say.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Peter.
How long was I gone?
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Make that two.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Something like that.
You're willing to die for this.
Really.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
The final countdown.
Thank you.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Have your department make a full report.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Here, Mom.
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
Gotta go, Arletta.
You steal a car?
Git to work!
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Yes, Boss.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
You jes' watch us!
Get away!
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
That's it. That's the end.
Like an elephant.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Take it easy, Drag.
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
You just said he could eat anything.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
None of your fucking business.
Only kidding!
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Hal has it.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
You come and visit.
Who was the man in the basement?
You know where.
No.  Not yet.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
For months... last October.
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Why should I trust you?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
They get fan letters...
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Well, thanks.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
Not yet.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
Yes.  I have to go...
Go and look for a note.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Let's get out of here...
What about her arms?
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Right.
Good.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Helen Hudson...
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Give me Ruben back...
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
And her husband? What was he?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
You're not envious?
It does.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
One of your suitors?
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
I work in the immigration department there.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
No.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Yes.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
Where are you?
I did this already.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
And the party?
What about the engagement party?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Ecru.
I didn't say...
That's thanks to all your help.
I know.    I know.
Wow.   Congratulations.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
Anything interesting.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Paul.
The left one.
No rounds for another three hours.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Tell the doctor.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Do you like it?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Shhhh.
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
The restaurant, too?
I got worried. Are you OK?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Bingo.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
I think I should call someone.
Well then why'd it happen?
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
No.
I love him.
Here's the ring.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I'm glad you're doing well.
What does that mean?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Where did they go?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
He missed three weeks.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
Yes.
I assume you want something?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
We can't.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Where are you from?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
You didn't buy batteries?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think he's already figured that out.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
Fine.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Everything?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Good song though.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
I'm the driver.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
No.
No!
Get in the car.
They sort of got away.
Uh huh.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
I know where she went.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Oh, you think?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
And you don't speak French?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
I don't know.
Take a nap.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Something like that.
No.
Stick around and find out.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
What's it to you?
Let's go!
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
He is my defeated foe!
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
What do you think?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Only the sword will settle this.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give me back my comb.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Perhaps.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Shu Lien...
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
A murderer?
What does it say?
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
I knew that.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
It's only a flesh wound.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
You don't even remember...
Another jolly nickname?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Magic.
Your pain ends now.
Shelly?
Yes.
Go away.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
No shooting.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I'll be fine.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
No.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
What'cha reading?
Great book.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Yes.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
What are you doing?
I will.
Oh please.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
That's not fair.
I think that's for the best.
What are you saying?
Any ideas who it could be?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Eww. No. That's gross.
Something awful happened last night.
I did?
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Just taking your photo.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Some other time, Cecile.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Is it me?
I do.
Yummy.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Baby?  Right on time.
I told you to lock the door.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
You told her I never said I love you before?
And you think she bought it?
I'll be in touch.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Likewise I'm sure.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
It's Kathryn.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Racist piece of shit.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Be more specific.
I'm working on it.
Blow me.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Yippy.
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
She shot you down.
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Mock, mock, mock.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Come again?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Get out!
Excuse me.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Do you know when she'll be back?
We played backgammon?
Oh... no thank you...
What are you talking about?
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I'd love to.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Sometimes.
Are they nice?
But it's already come true.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
Yes, darling,
I'm never unfair.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
I suppose so.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
I live right here.
It was on account of the birthday party.
They ran away.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But there's no one here, darling.
I don't know yet.
This is more fun than just pretend.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
I'm trying to.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But she's such a nice lady.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Who is she?
Why hasn't he got a head?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
My daughter died long ago.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Come away, Amy.
Wait a minute. Listen.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
What else is there?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Does she have PMS?
So don't look in his eyes.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I don't know.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Did I kill him? Of course not!
And my bra finally fits again.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I think he called you beautiful.
No you don't, believe me.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
What? Why'd you do that?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
No.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Check out what I found.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
So you're Grant's secretary?
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Yes I do have to pee!
So pee? Here?
I can't help it, it smells so good.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
This really isn't a good time.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Goodnight.
Okay, you busted me.
No. I was doing my laundry.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
A man killed in Central Park.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Interesting possibility.
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
You got a dog?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
Take some allergy medicine.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
Why would you want to be a cop?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Like a vampire or some shit?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Not really...
The other one?
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Yes, sir.
Good.
Iím sorry...
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
But I...
Wait, this isn't fair...
You know something about me?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Yes.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
That's easy.  You...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Right.
A month.
Great.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Alan
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
What about her.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
Are you out of your mind?
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Sort of... Yeah.
It's fine.
The government
You could buy it on payments.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Wrong...
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
What?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Of course.
No.
Thanks, Duane.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I don't understand.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Mind if I sit down?
Anybody would have done it.
I don't know.
What?
I run a temp agency.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
All set.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Look.
Quiet!
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
The hospital? 
What you wanna do?
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Yep.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I think you're sweet.
But...
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Yes... sir.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Sure.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Sort of.
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
Yawp!
YAWP!
A madman.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Okay.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Isn't there an easier way?
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
You have another choice.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Yes sir.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Yes.  But
I don't want to read.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Do you have to quit the play?
We have to make it to the third deck...
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Then you better start swimming.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
The thieves.
You people...rich people...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
On the side!!
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
No...
I don't take orders at all.
He's not coming...
You ain't giving the orders here!
Me??
I have been.
Where is everybody?
You want some too?
Like Mamooli's country...
Maybe plans changed...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Good... Pass the beer.
Fuckin' A!
Who? Who is?
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Worse since she talked to who?
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, well...
Who's got the ammo?
Inside, Vince.
Nick, she won't say why.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Will you marry me?
Would you?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What?
I don't know.
I know.
The shot?
I don't think about the shot that much.
Pow.
From Nam?
Hunt with Vince?
What are you, God?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Merle...
Watch it, shithead!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
See you Monday.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Merle gave me this?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
No.
Down.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
Out of the room.
I'm not voting for you.
And I want Doucet.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Yes.
But Sergeant...
My insurance won't cover it.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Relax, let technology do the work.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
No, sir.
What else did he get?
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
I'm here.
...Have you been drinking?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Hospital food.
What's it mean?
Take a look at this.
Of course I will.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
That's my problem, Belle.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No! No! I won't.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Some other time, Stevens.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Never!
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Camomile tea!
Well -- yes --
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Oh, Jabez.
Who is it?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
We can still use my butter money.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
I don't know, Jabez.
Consarn the consarn --
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Hard luck -- like me.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I object.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
Why don't you?
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
No, sir.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Tell me about it.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
And if he alters it...?						*
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Only if New Jersey counts.
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
When you're hot, you're hot.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Sure.  Follow me.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Don't I always?
Holly Gennero?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Roy?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't call yourself fat.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Well...
You're crazy.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
They're okay.
I frisk you?
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
What do you want?
Sonny, come on out!
They were ...
What else?
I can take care of that.
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
I took too long.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Yes...
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
All right ... send them the guard.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Does that still go?
Get over there!
Have him walk in backwards.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Let's move it, goddamn it.
Okay.  Which one goes?
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
No!
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>

I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
Where is the money?
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Take us to Vegas.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.

This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Must you use that awful word?
I can certainly think of one more!
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
No. What's the big deal?
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Do you know where Danang is?
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
You got my back.
My brother.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
And?
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
You're welcome.
OK.  OK.
Wake up!
I'm in here.
I'm working.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
What responsibilities?
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Yeah, me too.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Don't worry about it.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
That's my name.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Can't do.
No, just checking.
Sal, I want my money.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Your memory is really getting bad.
I can run out and get it.
Then we'll do something else.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
To get my money.
I am a man.
You're still late.
Ya like him, huh?
That's what I think.
On the rebound.
I understand.
I love you.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
I'll tell you why!
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
In the new library there.
Depends how you define 'new'...
HARRY Dunne.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
What? No! Look.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Oh, is this your special place?
The second R is silent.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Who's Captain Rob?
Sounds like a pirate.
What?
Will not.
Shut up!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
They can't be real.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Some what?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
You're always your harshest critic.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY!
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Yeah, that's why I asked.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Do you know what this means?
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Try one in a million!
Hey, where'd you go?
That's gross.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Tomorrow night?
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
Do we have a deal?
He passed away three years ago.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Will that be on the midterm?
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Yes you are. 
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
And...?
Wow, you are smart.
Who's there?
What?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
What does Leto say, Piter?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
The Emperor's blade.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Always.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
SILENCE... SILENCE.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Stop him, Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Thank you.
Don't you bave a car?
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
I don't understand.
I am always on time.
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Who do I play?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Dracula?
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
So how'd we do?
Mmph?  Where am I?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Huh?
Don't let me slow you down.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Formaldehyde.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
I don't know.  Where?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
You mean a Tesla coil?
What do you mean?
I guessed.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
What?
Boris Karloff!?
I thought he was dead.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
I told you this was gonna happen.
Does she have room for me?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
What other sixty-thousand?
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
You could say that --
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
So you're not gonna make the movie?
So you're not a fruit?
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Not good...
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Bela died.
Well you tried --
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
You don't wanna be noticed?
Yeah...?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
YES!  JUST DO IT!
NOOOOO!!!
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Do they show it?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Come on...
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
No.
I'm moving out.
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
A woman wants to be pursued.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Really? They were..
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
When? Today?
Right, right...
Yeah?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Mm.
Oh my God!!
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Dynamite.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
That's lucky.
I know, I ...
No. Who?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on...
No... Could you?
What?
Come on.
You're in show business?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
What?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
You brought the cameras here!
Please!
I know.
Ray, come an--
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Ed... I'm sorry.
What?... Why?
Hi.
Good?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Anything wrong?
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
But, Mr. M. -
I know.
Ethics are...
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Hello, Tracy.
Yes?
Would you sign it for me?
Walt needs to see you.
I did it.
Door was open.
Here?
You're there.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
What?
So?
Yeah.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
Yeah.  But not for long.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
Call me Dudley.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
How?
You've got it, Wendell.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
I got to write my report first.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Lynn.
Which one are you and which one am I?
At least not anymore.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I'm not asking you.
I got her address.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Someone must've pulled the records.
Say what and so what.
Say what?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Okay.  I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Where'd you hear that?
What's wrong, Trash?
Yeah.
Oh Jesus.
Who are you calling?!
Who are they?
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
What do you mean?
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
<u>Here</u>?!
You sure?
Those are Feds.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
What if--
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
C'mon.
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Well then who can?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Pardon?
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
A report?
About what?
What kind of trouble.
I'm not his attorney.
Because I don't know.
Yes sir.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
What happened to your head?
Well...yeah.
That was for Christmas.
Yeah.
It's over.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
When do I get to meet him?
Brill.
It's how he works.
All right, look--
You got a minute?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You have to.
I'm sorry about that.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
--otherwise we may have to--
We'd rather not--
--otherwise we may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Merry Christmas, son.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Really?
Do I know you?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
What about jewelry?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Bobby--
Bobby--
Calm down.
Rachel's dead?
Why would the NSA--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
I have a family.
How can I reach you?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
You would?
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
I just meant--
We believe?
You're kidding me.
So they know everything.
Do you have visual?
What's your ETA?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
What kind of fossils?
I don't want to go back.
Excuse me?
What do you mean, poetry?
Oh my God, the others!
Now.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
What?  No!
It's a folk song.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Don't go over it again, please.
What?
No.
A surprise, he said.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Still a car.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Appropriate?
Could I trouble you for some water?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
What's the matter with you?
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Okay.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
So you can shoot a pistol?
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Please don't creep around this house.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Moose.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
What?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Aren't you?
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Are you crazy?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
You'd better be.
I'm not sewing anything else.
I love you.
I've met you before.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
You get Hardy.
You loved him.
I try not to expect you.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
A bit of one.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Bingo.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I sincerely hope so.
No. Why would I be?
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
You can't.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
Terrified. Still am.
Duh.
The Mask.
There is no big job.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Transfer.
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Call it a new tradition.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
You can do it.
But--
You gave them the eight billion.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It better be worth it for me.
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Right.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Yeah.
Five million dollars.
Yup.
If you hadn't used profanity --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Where's Anna?
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
Show me the document that proves that.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Erin --
Right.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
That's right.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
How come you're not eating?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Well I hate it.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Better safe than sorry.
Thanks for reminding me.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
What do you want, a joke?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Uh-huh?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
And code the signal to my private chamber.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I feel The Force.
You won't.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Good.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Why?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Can you trust him?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
You may call me Leia.
Not really.
Thanks.
You're part of the mining guild then?
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
That sounds familiar.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Closer?!
I thought you knew this person.
What did you say?!
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Believe what?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
And we can watch ...
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
We'll see.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
What?
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I don't know yet.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Can you land?
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
A medical team will be standing by.
Lock fuel rods.
It's history. I gotta go.
So where's Plissken?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
You need help.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Sewers. Come on.
What the hell is this?
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Move aside!
I will not.
So be it, to the death.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
That's not why you came.
In the great book.
The dragon! There...
What is it my child?
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Rise, Mordred.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Not you, my husband?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
--Nothing!
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
That I cannot.
People make you laugh?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Thank you your excellency.
In here!
Hi, how'd your day go?
What didn't he tell you?
Of course I didn't.
Storage.
No. Not at all,
Please.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Really? wow.
You're a nice man.
She is going to be well?
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
Depression?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Pretty close.
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention her.
That depends.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
What else?
No
No.
Um........Stuff.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Your kidding?
The closet
Here I'll show you.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Okay.
Honey it's to help you.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
St. Mike's.
Damien Karras.
So what's wrong with her?
How's the girl?
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Ego te abslovo.
Uoy era ohw.
Why?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
But deliver us from the evil one.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
In the face of the enemy.
Amen
Amen
And also with you.
Her heart.
She'll go into coma.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
What's this about?
Only what I read in the papers.
Yeah, a fall.
Sick priest, is that it?
Who's in it?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Yes.
Twelve.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
We have some lotion.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Baker.
How will he eat?
No bones?
Get your hand off me.
How's the birthday girl?
My pleasure.
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Jack...
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
So do I.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
It wasn't like that.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
Here, how's this?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Right.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Two hours ago!
How come I didn't hear anything?
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Twenty-eight years.
I don't know.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Shut up, Frank.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
All right.
All right.
I'm sorry?
Well, that's fine --
Right.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
My watch is broken, too.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
Do I look like I'm naked?
Am I missing something?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Huh?
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Born and bred.
Job.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Frank works hard.
He leads, I follow.
Pretty much.
For a while.  She left.
The Stratford.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
How do you know?
Ed? How many people live here?
Sure.
So, what happened?
You don't pick your brother.
Huh?
I've given it up.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Eddie did.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Eddie.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
He hit a guard.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Should be.  It's yours.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
For what?
Is that what you think?
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Five seconds.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
What?
You can't blame me for trying.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
No problem.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
What about me?
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Who did?
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
Big Ed’s.
Like what?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Is it...?
Kate’s my wife...
It’s me, Jack...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Everyone needs something.
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
Please.  Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
Okay, chief.
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
For us, Kate.
I was in the city.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
Because you’ll be here.
You’re kidding me...
No, she’s not.
...my feet are hurtin’...
And...?
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
She got those shoes...
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
If you want to look at it that way...
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
It’s good, right?
No, open it...
Zeena...
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Okay...
A perk for what?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Of course I did.
I've got plenty of places to go.
If it's something you feel strongly about.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Victor's better at these things.
<u>Should</u>?
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Victor did.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Oh, he did.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Victor must've taken him.
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Right, whatever, have fun.
Not this again --
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Reed, we're running out of time.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What?  What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Are you kidding?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
You <u>were</u>?
Why didn't you say something?
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
We'll know -- in the next breath...
Yes, Cora.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
We're pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
You left something out.
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
How are you, Miss Peterson?
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
I could use a lawnmower...
On the Repeater.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Then don't drift down further.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my daughter?
Certainly -
...What're you talking about?
I did.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Whoa, Daddy.
We split that.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Oh, yah, I know that!
You have children?
I unnerstand.
Oh sure.
Uh-huh.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Oh, yah?
Uh-huh.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You bet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Sir? Right now?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
No, no, fax is -
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Good day, sir.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Ya got the car?
...Who they playin'?
You told me about it.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
Yah.
Yah.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Ah, dammit!
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
Yah.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Gotta go?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Just a Diet Coke.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
I'm sorry, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay...
His wife?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Yah.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
That's terrific.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Yeah, both of us.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
This is... really a shock...
I'd like to thank the academy...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Marla?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
What do you get out of it?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We did make love?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
You fucking slut!!
What?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Okay, everyone.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Being clever.
There's always that.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Like hell.  That counted.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Doesn't matter.
Any historical figure.
A liposuction clinic.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
I don't know...
Work.  Going to work.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
Imagine how he feels.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What... ?
And, sometimes you control it...
I quit.
Yes.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why what?
... no, no, no...
Why are you doing this?!
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
What?
Maintenance.
Well, sir, you said you might.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
No, please, no, God, no!
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
You were there?
How you doing in there, hero?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Random, sure.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Carter.
Blow me.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
No.  What's this about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Yeah?
...My Premonition was just like his.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
I know how it feels to be dead.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I know.  I can feel it too.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I guess so.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I know, Dad.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
Who am I, David Blane?
I'm... really sorry.
As in flannels and plaids?
Like... 4:25.
I know who you are.
No harm. No foul.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Terry's name should be on this wall.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Star Wars?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
No cigarettes.
Let me see.
Nothing we can do, man.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Yes.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Where's his father?
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
What?
About 22 hours on site.
Am I out of here?
There were treating me like a headcase.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Well, there's nobody special!
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
What does that mean?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
How have you been?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
I was nine in the sixties.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Fifty dollars?
What are you doing?  Give that back!
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
So what? You going to help me?
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Who?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
You won't be alone for long.
No just Parry.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Shhh...
I leave it to you.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
A wig?
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You can sing the song.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I'm not.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
You'll be gone, period.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
It brings out my eyes...
I don't know.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Palm Apodaca.
I didn't get it, did I?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Are you talking to us?
Hi, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Everybody still up on the Island?
Wait...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Tita, I've got to go...
A couple of months.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
My turn.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
I guess you fell in the water.
That's dangerous, you know.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Tomorrow, then.
Thank you.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Shut up...
That's what you said?
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Yes.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What?
Is she?
What?
That's what I mean...
You're all full of shit!
It's a Borzoi.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Hold onto this.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Yes.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Aaron, how you doin'?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Victor.
Wussup.
Of course.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I kissed those girls.
I can't!
She fucks it all up!
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Wha'?
Yeah.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Nah.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
You mean her.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
That's Babar.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Funny old bird.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I'm fine.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Where are you going?
They bust you every week.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Yeah. Maybe.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Come inside.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Take it where?
Where am I going?
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
You've met her?
Cute thing.
How long have they been married?
So were my parents.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I love the outfits.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
You are a rich woman.
Yes.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
What is this?
That's what I want to know.
How do you know about that?
What does all this mean?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I think you better sit down.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
I want something I can print!
What...
Jim Swarthout?
In a minute!
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Oh... I have some questions.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you...
I'll do my best.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Right away!
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Fluck you!
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ye-ah.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
There's that question...
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
The case!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Julian, you're fired.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Everything is everything.
Doesn't register.
Yeah?
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It's yours too!
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Non!
Il fallait le faire.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
S'right.
Where from?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
We put him to bed for the night.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Why is it called Hellgate?
For garbage?
So what?
Nothing.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
The usual.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Wish you weren't.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Next time lets put some money on it.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Wait...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Yeah...I think so.
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I never knew you, Dad.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
It did, Pop.  It did.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
October 22, 1969.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
You really wanna know?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
It's not your fault, Dad.
No.
Okay, okay...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Where's Shelly?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I vote for me.
Yes, man!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Will you come with me?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Hello.  How are you?
Somebody was in here.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
It's deceiving.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Damn you, Shelly!
I have to.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
We're gonna scare him?!
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Okay.  There's one.
But what I get scared again?
Will you listen, dammit!
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I've seen it.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
I'm here.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Do you have to ask?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Have a good night.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
Okay.
Until I hear the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Ask me in about five minutes.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And you'll never do it again.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
The fire alarm...
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Walking corpses are not real!
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
He is not.
You're telling a lie.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Hi, Sean.
The window...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
That's where I peed.
Alla puttanesca.
Shut up, Elliot.
Do not inhale.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
What was it like?
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Then you should carry a gun.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
She's dying.
Can he get through it?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
In and out of bed.
Why do you need a radio?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
A flat-out hit.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
Life is good.
You're hurting my head.
Life is real.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
My back is killing me.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I know, Pop.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
That's a simple subject.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
I want to believe.
Why does it matter?
Why do you care?
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
What color?
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Where are you going now?
He goes to the theater armed.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
As I told you about English policemen.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Everyone takes his turn.
Stop!
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
"Hell!"
No, no -- just a moment, please.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
It was one incident.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
It's split the Government.
I dined at the prison.
Have you found him?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It's for the best.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
Jerome--?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
You had to be a right-hander.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You know I'm scared of heights.
What are you talking about?
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
I'm travelling too.
German, is that you?
That's the hair color in his profile?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why not?
We were just looking.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
What exactly is wrong?
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
No way. I've got to get out now.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Better than old times.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Sure.
Better than I remembered.
Is he straight?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Bullshit.
I see it...
Do it my way.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
What do we do?
I can handle it.
I mean it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
When are you going to learn?
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Not now.
No scars.
Whatever happens it's over.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Who was it?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Where?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Okay. How many bank exits?
What about the vault?
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Not now.
How about twenty thousand?
Just... tell us what you want.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
How?
When did you find out?
This is my brother's car.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
What about?
Jack, you're wrong.
Good evening.
That's nice.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
It's the truth.
So where are we going, Princess?
Of course. Where else?
Nasty.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Now you're asking.
Not entirely. No.
Sure I'm sure.
You've been watching the film.
I left last year.
Working at Woolworths.
Since when did he drink whisky?
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Where you off to?
Who's Brumby?
Oh yes? How?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Definitely.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
My brother, Frank.
Don't ask me.
Pension him off.
No.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
How could I stay away?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Making a living.
Can't say I do.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Still got your sense of humour.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
They do that up North.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
It's not right.
Eh?
...cower in his boots...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What hard part?
What?
Huh.
Men come work for you...
They...
What do you mean?
Yes...?
What?
Yes.
Talking about it as a...
No.  Not actually.
Have I said that?
What?
Yes.
Why would I do it?
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
What?  You can't do any what?
Huh?
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
No.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Go to lunch, will you...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
You're done, come down, and let's...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
Not lately it isn't.
...after the thirtieth...
Murray...
Either way.  You're out.
What if you don't close...?
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Twenty percent.
And fifty bucks a lead.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
You're so full of shit.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
That was easy, wasn't it?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
What sales?
Because I don't like you.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
They took the phones...
Mmm.
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Yes.
Oh!  For the magazine...
No, his wife is.
Kenilworth.
What do I...?
Mmmm...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
It's not me, it's my wife.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
What does that mean?
I...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Fuck the Machine.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
Did they...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
I got lots of presents.
She couldn't decide.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Michael...
Tom is right.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
He will grow strong.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
It's the way Pop wanted it.
He's an Italian?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Chi?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Kay... Kay...
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
Yes.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Sure, Mikey.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
I don't know.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I know he's in Israel.
Mike wants it.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Yes, Michael.
Yes, Michael, it does.
Get out of my hotel.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
That is a complete falsehood.
I do not.
You were unfair with them.
They feel cheated.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Turnbull is a good man.
It's important.
Sitting right behind you.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We got friends in the commission.
What's to be jealous of?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I'm not a kid.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
But I didn't do this!
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
All right, I guess.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
I don't like to talk about that.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
No.  I --
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Not at the moment.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Do you miss it?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
You're the one who started it.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
I'm game.  Sure.
Do I look okay?
If that's okay?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Catch my death.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Your friend?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
I think I'll hang around.
Good.  Fine.
I just want to watch it, okay?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
So what do I do?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
More your line.
Elsa?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Sure.
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Head.  Not heart.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Sit?
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
You know my back.
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Castlebeck.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
C'mon, man ...
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hey, Donny --
one minute -- !
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Remember who my brother is?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
What do you say, Toby?,
Yeah... You want a ride...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
What do you got ... ?
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
Otto called -
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
The family that steals together, deals together...
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
I'm cool.
What?
I know ...
No problem -
Hospital.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
On account of me.
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
That what you want?
Okay.
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I take out my slim-jim...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
No worries ...
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
No we don't -
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So what's in there -- ?
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Look at Jeannie's kid.
Billy, how are you?
I understand.
You treated me like shit.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
What are you talking about?
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Paulie was just talking about him.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy  ...
No, no. It's okay.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
But, Paulie, please.
Please?
What? Come on!
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Next week.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Gone.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Ah, history I think.
How you doin'?
This is your house, right?
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
I have about seventy-three...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
History.
Good, it was all right.
That's one aspect of what we do.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Really?
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I don't know what it's called.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Uh-oh.
Since Nancy died.
That would be fine.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Now wait a minute--
--Gerry--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
I don't know. India maybe.
Never been.
Sounds good.
There is somebody...
He was my roommate in college.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Like what, Will?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
285.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
No, I don't.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
That's right.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
I don't know.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Yeah, I think so.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Okay, sounds good.
What?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Okay...
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
We'll do that.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
What am I scared of?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
An' you say no cops?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Crate fell on me.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
What you figger to do?
You're right!
Casy! What you doin' here?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Naw--not much!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
You been acrost?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
California.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
But who done it?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Me an' you both.
Man bones?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I never--
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I'm Martin Blank.
Don't say that.
What?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Here is now there. There is here.
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Yep.
Bad experiences.
Unbelievable.
Yes.
As long as I get the laugh.
What?
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Like heroin?
Yes.
No.
It's something I do...
Get the fuck outta here.
Jesus Christ!
You don't understand...
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
--Nooo--
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
This?
That's going to cost.
I'm not happy.
And they want me to make up for it.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
All by yourself?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
It is cocktail hour yet?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Need a lift?
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Five years. My son was born here.
How did you find out all that?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I won't ask you to.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
No, you just act like you do.
I think they call it a pasture.
Did you go riding?
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
I said... I started.
My period.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
What?
I should be in by two.
Yeah. Bye.
Doing what?
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Why?!
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
We have a business manager. The best around.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
What?
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
He thought it was a ghost.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I don't know if I can.
No!
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
NO!
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Alright sir.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Difficulty rating?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Yeah? Display?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Mm-hmm.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Hmmm.
And unpack.
How did you know that?
Okay. Let's go shopping.
What?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Are you challenging me?
Make it my first born.
I'm sorry, I can't.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll make it up to you!
It's my subway defense system.
I'm trying to help you.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
What's happening?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Hey, it's me.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Real charmer.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
This morning.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Not without Jamie.
I don't know!
What does that mean?
Get back!
Brady! Come with us.
Get up there Rachel!
Go!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I can see this is useless.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Like a sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Double scoops?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
No.
Hi.
Don't you mean what you do best?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't want to look pushy.
Jamie?
Its not over yet.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
What are we doing?
Got it Ben.
Dear God.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
What's going on?
He shouts, too.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
We just talked.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
He can still watch.
Thanks.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Yeah.
Lee Brackett.
He isn't a man.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Have a good time.
Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I promise.
Was it the bogyman?
No! Do as I say.
Let's make more popcorn.
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Only minimum security.
What does that mean?
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Well, let's hope so.
A lot of works.
Mmm.
Uh...
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And it ruins everything else.
When did you first notice this?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
I don't know exactly.
What are you doing here?
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No?
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Well, sure.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Oh, right.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
But not over me?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Aren't they great?
Are you angry with me?
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Oh, honey!
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Mom, come out!
No, nothing.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
I'm sorry.
I'm saying it now!
Yeah.
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
You know... 
Hello?
Like what?!  What?
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
How are you?
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Huh?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Well, then a third opinion.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yeah.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
It's, uh, you never know--
Singing?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Well-well, like what?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
You want some?
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
No!
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Yeah, it was.
Well, I hope you've changed.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
You have.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Okay.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Mmm, what?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
Hmm.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
...read it over, and think about it.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I'm going to tell you later....
...I was <u>working</u>...
I hereby acknowledge that...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Orderly.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Then who's buying it?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...they did it for a lark.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Have the child taken to bed.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Try Barney Clark.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Mmm...
Shut up, Starling...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
I think its meaning is clear.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...how so?
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
No. 
...who say...?
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
...and my need for The Institution...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<u>Yes</u>.
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
...would you use a small word?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
That's right.
I..
Yes.
...yes...?
When?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Nothing.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
How do you mean?                                            ]
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Talking while kissing.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
You're beautiful.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Heather? Wha...
Color me nauseous.
Yeah, maybe.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give me the clipboard.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Sure.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
I don't really like your friends either.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Chick-en.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on through.
Is it hurting, dear?
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
is very angry.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
It's so beautiful!
You mean travel by ourselves?
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Mummy!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
All finished.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Someone special.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
I said she's been missing for-
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
What's that?
What?
Uh... eighty two?
What?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
A little? Try unbelievably.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Ambulance.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
You mean John Bubber?
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Me!
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Vietnam!
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
John, I know all about it.
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
Said he's not an actor.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
Dad!
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Okay.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
-- a sense of proportion.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Just show me the way.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Uh huh.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Here, take this out to the table.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
What?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Damn.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Huh?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Philip!  The senior partner?
He wasn't there.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Isn't it?
What for, dickweed?
Put it out, man!
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
I have a cold.
It's a double.
Even cosier.
Not now.  I'm busy.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Aye.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
I'm sure they will.
Living.  Remember?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No.  What am I to do?
No -- after you.
She's a treasure she is.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Because it's my name.
Jennifer.
New York is dangerous place.
You're twenty minutes late.
I know.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
How could they get by him?
And this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I can take care of myself.
Me too.
Why?
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You think we should take that chance?
You won't die if you let me help.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Like what?
I'm not going to die for this!
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about the cop?
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Use more ice.
They'll cut the power.
What hospital?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I think you got no choice.
Yeah.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
I know.
How about dog shit?
Stop it.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
We're okay.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Who is it?
No!  They're right here --
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
What do you want?
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
I don't have that much.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Get in.
Today.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Business is good at the hotel?
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Just drive, Gregoire.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Why sir?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
That will take time.
What?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need a great favor.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
He wants your wisdom.
We must do something.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Murdered! By whom?
It will do just fine.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
What?
I want to know.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
How dead?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Many beers.
When?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
-- what was he doing here?
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
As a tumor.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Did it work?
Left, goddamnit!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Back where?
It's succeeding!
Run.
I don't do groups.
Jesus!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Maybe if I --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- no more --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
The lockdown thing.
What's going on?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
He must've unsealed the room!
Keep talking, I'll find you!
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
A few years older, perhaps.
That poor little girl.
By killing them?
I don't understand.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Yes.
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Don't be afraid!
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
Whatever you say.
Or what she was worth.
So what are you saying?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Are you ok?
No...  NO!
I'm ok.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Maura.
It was a shame.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
What!
Thank you.
The amulet...
What are you getting at!
We'll be there.
Not at all, if it can help.
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
So where is it?
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Right.  Right!
Right.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
Did you know him?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Would you know this store again?
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Fuck you!
It has already begun.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Gum.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
You sound disappointed.
Anna, I think you better stay....
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Last rites, sister?
Ooh-kay...
You're supposed to be dead!
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Oh.  Well, what's this?
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Trust Leonardo....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
But you're going to tell us anyway...
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Alchemy.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Tell me about it...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Why yes, do you know it?
...Why don't I just type this up...
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
You know, on farm route 17.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Norville!
Oh Norville, I --
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
He grins wolfishly.
Forty-eight years...
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
...Geez.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
But, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
And Sid says you stole it!
Norville.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Yeah?
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I --
Wait a minute!
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
But, sir! --
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Ya get the special?
She looks in her purse...
...Her mother needs an operation...
Where?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
You don't believe in it?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Yes.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
Did you hear what he sang?
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
You can't really believe that.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Of course not!
Good morning.
I often do.
I imagined this so differently...
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
And as usual no one believed me...
I wasn't star--
So maybe you'll come too?
You want to go?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Yeah.
Sure dad.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Huh?
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Let me.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Yeah. You?
With Mikey?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It's not like we're too busy.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
They say you never forget.
I gotta get to English class.
Am I right or am I right?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Who said so?
Sure, anything but this English.
Out.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Yeah.
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Are you his girlfriend?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
I had him!
Actually...
Yeah.  All over.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
First I need a copy of the key.
That's right.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
What are we thinking?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
I'm always all business.
What is it?
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Huh?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
What was?
What was it?
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Yes.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
He.  Well, he...
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
This an accident, Walter?
Ah! You have questions?
Your lover.
She is.
We can do that?
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I can't save her.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
I didn't realise.
It will grow back again!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
What have you done?
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Be still!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Never.
That's not so.
So you felt it too!
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Then my luck would have changed.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Do you think so?
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Are you mad????
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
I tried...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
Can a vampire feel love?
How could I not? She had to know.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Yes...
My daughter...
Yes!
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
What are you doing in my closet?
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Karla! You promised.
Yes.
Just kidding.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
They never found the body.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
What do we do?
You're okay. Thank god.
Why are you being like this?
Can't what?
This weekend?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
I told you.
I don't know.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
It's...him.
Did you get help?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Hey --
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
You don't have to be a jerk.
Drunk again?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I donut understand.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
I think not.
I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
On my word! That's what they believe.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
That should decide it or you --
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
You wouldn't tell that ——
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
I don't understand you.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
She's not too well.
Hero?
Thea?
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can't.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Who?
All right –– all right.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Carter –– bank examiner.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
Our clothes are dry.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Made what?
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
Yes, but George . . .
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
The Building and what?
I know. I know.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
All in . . .
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Came back three days ago.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Oh, George!
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Say, where's Mother?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Nothing.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Right down here.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
You like it? I'll send you a box.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
I'll take chocolate.
Neither am I.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
You may kiss my hand.
Come on, tell me.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Mary . . .
That does it –– come here.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Thanks for dropping around.
My baby.
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
What?
You going to the lighthouse?
With butter, if they got any....
Swim for it!
Yeah.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Yee-hah!
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Sean!  Catch it!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
It's still there!
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
What camera?
Got it.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
You said something about a camera.
What else you got?
Too late, it's written.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
What's that supposed to mean?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Home it is.
As far as the office.
It's good with coffee.
In the den.
Do you?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Just one minute....
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
It's still a good idea.
What for?
That's it?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
What's daddy doing?
Now I really want to see it.
Great.
Maybe.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
That's a crock of shit.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
Mike?  Our Mike?
Figure they split?
What the hell is it?
Power line.
I'm not sure I can.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
I love it.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You going with Patrick?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
You always go with Andy.
Eat Cheerios.
Maybe.
Would you take him?
Len, can I see you a minute?
Forget it, he won't listen.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
No.
What is it, 97 days?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
See you later.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Up.
Are you coming...?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Yes?
Me, too.
I don't understand.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
Yes, aren't we all.
Make this quick!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Afraid I can't do that.
Still sleeping.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Thanks to you.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
How'd it get in here?!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Don't blame yourself.
He's missing.
Sure.  No problem.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Come on!  Check this out!
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
Don't you dare.
What?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Aww, can't I keep it?
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Polar bears in Georgia???
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Always do.
Right, Mike.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
That bugger moves fast.
Nowhere....
No way....
We forgot to stop at the store.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Then don't come any closer.
But it went away...We would have known....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
You caught me....
It's beginning....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
He knows what he has to do....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
He heard that.
What's going on?
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
You're silly....
It's not nice to be evasive.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
Thanks for the consultation....
I'll miss you....
Mother....
What?
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
I'm not going to quit now....
Promise me....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
It could have been an accident....
Where do I pull off...?
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
I do....
Just like that?
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
You got a better idea...?
It needs more time to charge.
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Inch by inch....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
The readings suck....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Put me down, damnit....
I didn't do it on purpose....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
How long has he been here...?
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Mom....
Oh, Jake... 
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Yeah?
Is it your vehicle?
I hope I'm not intruding?
I think you're here all day.
The <u>dogs</u>?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
I already did. What's his problem?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Pay me, and I shut up.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
You looked like you did?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I guess by the bed.
I thought it was Taylor's case?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
No .. But we have a theory ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Of course I would ..
You should. It's wonderful.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
He said that? What else did he say?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I don't want them to arrest you.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
I know about the bachelor party.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
No.
There is something missing here.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
I see what you're saying.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Bill, Rod, wait --
Oh, tell the story.
My son... my mind...
You think so?
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Same to you.
We are?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Mission... statement...
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Bye you guys. _ 88.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
What --
You want...
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Good.
We decided to stay with you.
I'll give it everything.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
You.
Fine.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Good deal, man.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Damn right.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
What --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
What DO you stand for???
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Can you be quiet?
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
One way to find out.
What is it?
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
I filmed this the morning they left.
No, it's...
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Who's that?
Here!
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Where is it?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
I don't think so.
NO!
You think they could talk to each other?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
In Costa Rica?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Then we go home?
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Back out! Move!
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Where does it say that?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
To collect my fee.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Good.
Possible.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
She's nuts.
It has a broken leg!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Look!  Sarah!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Are you insane?!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?!
Birdshit?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
The door security systems are shutting down.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
John....
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
The Cretaceous.
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
I know.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Anti-nature.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Yeah.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Try to!
We gotta do something.
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Wu?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
I'll stay awake.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That was great!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
No. You've told me all I need to know.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
So what do we do?
Not yet.
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In what sense?
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
Then its authority is in doubt.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I'll commit that to memory.
Yes.
... My ... social situation?
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I suspected that he -- well.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Usually.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
You mean you've actually begun some?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
It usually is.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Oskar.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
No!
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
) They are now.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Coz of something I lost.
Compassion.
What about him? Yes.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
You think people hate you.
No.
Well we're pretty --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Mm.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
No thanks.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You said you wanted these.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
No, I said what did you think.
Yeah, you got to me.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
Don't touch anything.
How do you know how bad it was?
I don't think so.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
I better keep looking.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
It's in the report.
All right.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
I think she's trying that.
Then how are you involved?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I looked it up.
Yeah.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
What else do you know?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
He's in his room, playing.
Detroit.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Lunch in a restaurant.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Mom, I mean dad?
In a minute...
That's okay...
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
I'm allergic to onions.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
No!
You're no bargain either, pal.
Uh huh?
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
See you in the morning light...
You like it?
Uh huh...
No, she never did.
No.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Who will read me my stories?
No, I did not.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I don't know...
Yes...How's Billy?
Such as?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, do you love him?
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Sure.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
I don't believe you.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Right.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Fine.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
It's going to cost.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Any prospects?
Ten.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Ha!  You tell me.
Yes. I am ready.
Again?
It is alright, Father.
No!
I will not approve it.
I have.
Soon.
Time to study.
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes.
Far, far away.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
How many?
I am him.
Roughly five thousand men.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Can India help us?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
I will not go.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
But you will always be here?
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
No, Holiness.
How could I ever leave?
Completely.
What would you do, Holiness?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Too young?
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
What the hell are you doing?!!
A spring trap!
They don't really attack underwater and--
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
So profound and fat.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
That's actually the easy part.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Never been to Maine before?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I'm sorry but you're...
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Excuse me?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Ssssh!
I heard something.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You calm down!
Alright, Jack!
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Yeah.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Obviously I was wrong!
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
You too.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I thought I saw...
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
<u>Apologize</u>?
Hector thinks you like him.
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
She's worried about the cow now.
Kevin, hey.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
The somebody else part?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kelly--
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Backstabber?
Shitbutt?
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Thanks, Ardelia.
Why not?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
I will... I promise.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Thanks.
I think we may be, yes.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Who's the subject?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
All flayed...?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
I never thought about it.
I don't know. Is it?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Mmm. And what else...?
No! That's incidental.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Lecter -
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
I'm sorry.
How did you learn English?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Sorry to disappoint you...
...never doubt what you are doing.
Alice?
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
That is sedition! Treason!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
That's all, sir.
And what is that?
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Granted, Monsieur.
France.
La victoire.
He did.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
What?...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
He did.
What dead one on the ship?
Crunch...Implosion.
Can you fix it?
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
How much time does that give us?
Can't we fix it?
Where's Jones?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Ahhhh!
Okay.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Russian.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Twelve hours!
What are you going to do to him?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Like a leech.
I ought to smack your face!
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Hardly.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Well, talk.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
It's hit us all hard!
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
It's a Samoan pub.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Just carrying a bag.
Try that one.
All right, Dad.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
All right, Kenny.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
OK, open the gate.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Hit the fuckers.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Right as rain.
You will what?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
That's going on optimism.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
I can't take any more school.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I-I can do the job, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
That's in Maverick County.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Do I seem jumpy?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
So that's him--
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
He a Black man or an Indian?
So they stayed in Florida?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Dad--
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You know who it was they dug up?
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
That's where he fell.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
That's right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Protection?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
We have a daughter.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Right.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Steve?
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Well, you hire illegals--
He was killed.
I never said that.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
It's Saturday.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
They've got my Amado.
We haven't talked since high school.
Are you okay?
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Amado.
Yeah.
Nothing.
I came back 'cause you were here.
Yeah.
Yeah--
Gotta be in person.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
What's up?
Name's Otis.
Uh-huh.
I know that.
You believe that?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
They go together.
Nix?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Why would I do that?
All right.  It was...
He won't.
It's him... it's him.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Did your husband know Quaid?
I don't know where you'd start.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
And they all came...
Hang on!
Good.  There.  Yes?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
He got up and walked.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Mr. D'Amour?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Maybe I just bought it.
Probably.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Yes.  It's regrettable
What for?  You need to stay busy?
No.
I tried to pay you off.
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Have you been in?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Is that all?
And you believed him?
Yes?
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Is he the Puritan?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
You'll do it?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Two years.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm here for the week.
Hi, Charlie.
Ok.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Fuck off.
Yeah, look at that thing.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Yes?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Is this a bad time?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
What?
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Ok.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I don't know.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Sushi.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I can't believe Will killed him.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Claire...
Yes.  It's exactly...
What time did you make it for?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
He will.  He has great faith.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Miette, come here and relax.
You just call?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Peter, please...
Please, the children.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
When's your birthday?
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
What's the bible for?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
What are these?
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
The blue.
Are you okay?
What'd you do?
You're a caterer?
This time get your feet set.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Why not?
No.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Yeah, right.
Chances are there's still a chance.
What's up, Sidra.
Just like that?
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Would you watch the damn road?
Yeah.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
None of your business.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Yeah.
I said fine.
Plan to.
Right here.
I wanted you to.
She understands.
It happens, right...
Nobody.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Cheap date.
I never asked you to choose.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
What do you mean?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Better late than never, right?
For what?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
Tell me what?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
Your door was unlocked.
You want me to fuck off?
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
No.  No.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
baby, please, please --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Did you hear what I said?
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
It's fine.
Bit messy.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
If you're not here for a 422 --
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
What?
I'm sorry --
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
I've got troubles.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Cynthia?
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Son, don't --
-- no.
Son, please, now....
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
I'm a rapper.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Gently, son --
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces.
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
I'm trying.
She loves you.
Yeah.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
No.
Graduation?
Is this 509-9027?
Alright.  Thank you.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Let's talk about --
What am I doing?
-- fuck you.
...this close...
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
What name?  My name?
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Yeah.
Uh. huh.
Mmm.
...ok...
I don't think, he can't...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
No.
I didn't hear anything.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
Did your wife find out?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
I need you to get me Paula --
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Will that help?
Yes.
Rose, I don't --
Paula.  Ellen.
How long with Paula?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I'm not through asking my questions.
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
Did you ever touch her?
I really don't know.
I'm her father.
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Linda --
Hang up the phone.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
818-753-0088.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Yes. What? Yes.
What do you do?
-- the fuck are you talking about?
We need more dog food --
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Love you too.
It's ok.
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
M'lady...?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
Shut up, knave!
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
I am with you!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
I know.  God go with you.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
It is also a place of burial.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who does?
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I know.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
To kill the king.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Whose rooms are those?
She will be at the ball.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
And you never knew why?
Phillippe.  Rest now.
I decided it this morning.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Yes, your Majesty.
No, Keeper.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Sire, I --
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Don't worry -
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Fine...
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
What?
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Up north.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Please...
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
I'm not going anywhere!
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Not with this...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Where is he?
That was Peterson upstairs.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
When do they go to press?
I have to.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
No other possibilities?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
Wait, Will...
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
You wanna watch this or what?!
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
What?
He went to the men's room.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Tooth...
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
I don't know...
Oh, God.
Please, no.
No.
Absolutely,
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
No. I can help you.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
And you said?
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
You haven't smoked in two years.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
You going back down to Florida after?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Are you George Sherman?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
...after a while.
No.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Pretty well.
Yes.
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
What's up?
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Hi... am I late?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
You're a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Are you sure?
I'll take my chances!!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Where?
They're gonna lynch him!
It's my name.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
It's already begun.
Hurry!
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Right...
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
I got you.
Goddamnit!
Go.
He's beginning to believe.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Yes.  Now.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
It's an honor.
Far from it.
You've never used them before.
More important than what is when?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
What do you believe in?
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
How did you know...?
Honestly?  I don't know.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
From you.
... shit.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
Are you worried?
No.
Yes.
... right as rain.
We can't leave him!
There has to be something that we can do.
Not yet.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
What are you talking about?
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Hurry, Neo.
Let go of her.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Anybody wanna have a game?
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Jewish...
Panther!  Same thing...
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
I understand.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Mind your own business.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
$20.
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
No you weren't.
Oh...around...why?
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
What do they expect you to say?
Here.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
You're intolerable today.
I know...I know.
The girls like it loud.
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Yeah, so things'll be even.
Yeah, I think so.
You what?
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
You think so?
No.
Of course.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
'Goddam party'!
But what?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
You mean this, sir?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Hi.
What 'business'?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Am I not obligated to?
Cold.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
Did you just hear something?
No no, not you.
Yes.
Uh -- he's from out of town --
'Just kidding'?
Certainly.  Goodnight.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Well, that's very interesting.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Make it time.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
No.  Nothing.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Yes?
Hey, this is fun.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
I didn't know that.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
I'm sorry.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I haven't.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Watch me do what?
Yes.
Excuse me?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I loved it.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
No.
What do you mean?
Of course.
Not this.
I understand.
Yes.
You tell me, Bill.
That's okay.
Just a manner of speaking.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Say again?
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Get him in here.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
I'll take it from here --  I am --
An indictable offense.
Thank you.
'...Yes --'
What?
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
I am.  With you.
You mean like you loved Mom?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
We've met.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I don't know.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
Yes, but --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
You and 'Honey'?
I'm sorry --
I agree --
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
No --
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
That's it.
Couple days.
Seen you together, that's all.
This isn't my room?
When was I in here?
Why?
Just two. So far.							  *
Leonard.
Interested in buying one?
Yeah, I remember you.
I don't want blood on them.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Just relax.
What happened?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Help me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
About your whore of a wife?
Why not?
What?
Are you Teddy?
So why did you come here?
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You're in a playful mood.
I don't remember.
John Gammell?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Why?
Fucking hope not.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Why would I have a gun?
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
What's your twenty?
Turn around.
"And" what?
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
She's dead...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
That's right.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Twenty-eight-point-five.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
When?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Something's wrong.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
Nothing.
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
This is Agent James Fujima.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
How will it stand up?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
He did volunteer one time...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Bored.
What's it say?
"Future" of...?
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
I had to lay eyes on you.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Alonzo...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Lotta rich women back there...
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
I ain't sleepy.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
For money for what?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
You like it? Take a look.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
History, man, history. How much?
We go through the wall?
What?
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Ziat!
Everything.
Oh Jesus! 
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Not far. Just a little way.
I'll pay extra
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
...She was on the plane.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
About as good as it looks.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
He wasn't even in the car?
What do you mean?
And?
Billy!  Please!
What do you mean?
What's that?
Section 13?
What?  You gotta be joking.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
You know where it is?
Max - where?
Work, work, work, that's all do
Shit.
Weird shit...?
H-how do I get...?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Depends.  You got a memo?
I pull.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
What?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Don't get kinky here...
No, there's...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
What-
Peter...
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
That's it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Oh, Jesus.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Nothing.
It has no nobility.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
My pleasure.
Well, I hope you like it.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Perfect.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pills NOW!
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
I said that?
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Yeah, yeah...
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
A toast?
You really think so?
It is.
No, I haven't.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
You don't know?
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
Oh, I like that tone.
What is it?
It's good you found it.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
If I can.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
No, the typing kind.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
From her point of view or mine?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Well that depends.
How do you that.
Oh, I am.  Later..
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
Well, that's good, isn't?
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
..or hard wired..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Then we got'em!
I'm not ready!
No.  Should I?
What if I pay the rent?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Ethan Hunt.
They've got a book for everything.
Which is?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Just like old times.
Just about..
Affirmative.
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
Ethan, tell me -
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Yes.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
I'm fine..
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
She must still be on the property.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
So what do you suggest?
What about him...?
Good idea.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Always.
Krieger.
Don't move.
Who is "they?"
You're sure about this?
Sure...
Bastard!
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
The arms dealer.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
What about Job?
Let's move!
Where exactly is it?
We'll see.
Always.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
- and picked us up in the States -
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Yeah.
Youíre probably right.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
I don't know.
Jack...that's spying.
Twenty minutes.
This wasnít what we discussed.
No, I'm going.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
He did?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
And what did they say?
Good morning, Lucy.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
He's in Palermo.
I'm going to marry him.
I don't understand.
Maybe I should come back another time.
Bus hit him.
Seven years ago.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Because I have no Luck!
Me neither.
I was dead, too.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
Take it easy.
I can't do that!
I can't!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Hi.
Awful?
I think that's it.
How can you ask me that?
That's right.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Hi.
Maybe you're right.
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Where you been?
She recovered.
That's a pretty big sin.
You should think about this.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
I am alone in the world.
What happened?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
That woman was a student of yours?
I'm a housewife.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Sure.
Good night.
My God, it's a mansion!
What? What?
What would he be doing down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Did you dress her up like this?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Yes!
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
We don't have a lord.
Who are they?
We want ... a shrubbery!
And not too expensive.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
No, no ... not "is"!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
So be it!
Come on then.
Had enough ... ?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
You're a looney.
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Just keep me covered.
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
What?
I warned you!
Who did we lose?
Man!
Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
I'm not dead!
I'm getting better!
Do me a favour.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your quest?
I can't take him.
When's your next round?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
The Prince ... ?
Oh, I see,  Right.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, no, we must find the Grail.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Not down south you don't.
Seventy a year.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
She'll be worried about me.
You watch your tongue.
It's a diary.
What do you take me for?
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I can't move to tidy.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Louder, girl!
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Out of my way!
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
My own.
I beg your pardon?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
Occasionally.
Quite.
It's nothing.
I'm not married.
I wouldn't know.
She trusts you, John.
They aren't as watchful as you.
In time, she will.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
The question is, do we need her?
No, she wasn't.
Dear oh dear.
The same, your Majesty.
What is he doing there?
Why?
Again?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Your Majesty --
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Yeah, who isn't.
How do you do that?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Hey, kid.
I'm in the middle of it...
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
What?!
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
I don't know.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
Everything.
Dante's Inferno.
What?
We're actually inside, aren't we?
One.  In case...
Screamer.
That way.
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
I'm going home.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You gotta be kidding?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Whatever.
Okay.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Very pleased to meet you.
May I have your name please?
But it said #12.
Oh...
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Find out who they are?
Interesting.
Where at?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Making ends meet, huh.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Where's the dock ?
Leave him, he's dead.
Why should I ?
We wait. This is an elevator.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Fine...
Let's go.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Yes.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
When will that be ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I just want to double check the facts.
So ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Checking........
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Thank you, sir.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Sir ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
I don't know.....
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
You're paying the bills.
<<belch>>
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
Excuse me, gentlemen
Yes.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
What ?
I'm fine.
No.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I would do it again in a minute.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Thanks, I needed that.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Does she?
I'll try.
I've got something better.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Come on in!
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
MOM!
What difference does it make?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
Give it to me!
Just give it to me!!
Owh...
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
And you'd be my cousin?
He's an undertaker.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
They're great.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Not exactly.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
You couldn't?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
You're telling me.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I know, look at his little hands.
Vada!!
All right, here.
WHAT?
This guy bonking you?
I'm impressed.
What Hurts Vada?
Uhh, Miss devoto...
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
Okay.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
What happened to her?
It's only eight o'clock.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'll second that.
Dad?
You never cared before.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Get away, get away!!
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Will you tell her I came by?
Thank you. Bye.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Can we look around in your camper?
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
No.
Come here, sit down.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
Yes!!
Goodnight.
Liverpool?
They're just fun to read.
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It'll bleed.
Uh huh.
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
What?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Duck!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
Then go home, baby.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
I should look different.
Something like that.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
And you believe that.
Impressive.
I wish.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Can you watch the road?
What? Because I'm a little understand...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Let me rephrase that...
I was gonna predict that.
I've missed a step.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly.
That's entirely understandable.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Firenze.
What, leaving school...
I never eat when I'm serene.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
If you like.
Have you.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
A bad combination.
She admits it's her fault.
Well, it happens.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Like family, huh?
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
An so it is.
Right here.
I know that, Star.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Oh, sure.
Whose word?
Who the hell is he?
What!
Okay.
Okay.
Stop it!
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Harvard?
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
I think we can do that. Come in.
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
I'm not really a musician.
A little. What do you need?
I'1l get your bag.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Do you carry door handles?
Nash.
Sixty-three.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Yes, it is --
It just is.
I'm here.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Older.
Well...
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
How much?
Mary?
Do you study at all?
Hello.
What?
No, we never did that
You do?
You bet.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
You serious?
Sure thing.
Yes you are.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
What...
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Yeah.
Don't stop!
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Susanville, Soledade.
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Ain't love grand.
How's it goin'?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
I'm keen with anticipation.
All right, Mickey.
Don't worry about it.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Okay, let's cut it.
No.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
We are.  Your camera.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
Survival of the fittest.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Capt'n!
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
When do you want the assembly?
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Is that her real name?
Lose 'em.
I can't do that. Five guys.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
What d'you think?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where was that?
What did you say your name is?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Where was your father born?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Oh yeah?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
What d'you expect?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
I like a place with lots of life.
No thanks.
You got a problem all right.
Don't Duff--
You almost got into trouble back there.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No.
I didn't know you had one.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Well, what d'you think?
You still didn't answer my question.
Huh?
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
What're you going to do?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Duff--
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Who're you?
Great.
Okay.
No, thanks.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Thank you.
I guess not.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
It's for your own good.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
No. I only needed the code from you.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
The words?
You're pleasant tonight.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Yeah. That was me.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
No problem, amigo.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Can you take me to it?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How long, Dixie?
It's coming.
Why would you want me to kill you?
I think you're full of shit.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Too late?
Won't that mean you're dead?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Put the gun down, Case.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be okay.
I know you have. C'mere.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Petty good.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Exactly.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
YOU KNIT?
Nope.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Very romantic.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Transitioned?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
I know.
Really?
Thank you.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You remember that story?
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
To put us back together again when we fall.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Oh--yikes!
You were attracted to me?
But now you don't have to--
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I finally found my story.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Yeah. Definitely.
Everybody knows about--
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Can't you make other creations?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Oh, please...
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He's dead, you bitch.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
What about it?
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I know.
Wow...
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Oh, Jesse...
yeah, I had a bad night.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I'm not hungry.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
Okay, I guess.
No.  I'm okay.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Thanks, Mom.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
He's full of shit.
Mom?
Can't it wait till morning?
They're healing up nicely.
Don't hold your breath.
Watching TV.
No, she's right.
I -- I think so!
Can't be good news coming from you.
A little basic, but nice.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Thanks, Max.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
What's that supposed to mean?
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
For what?
I can do that.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
No...
How do we get in?
Mary Helena.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
I won't allow it.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Fine.
Here, let me help.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No thanks.
No.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
No, you were brilliant
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Yes.  Always have had.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Okay.
Hello.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Who is it?
Yes.
What's your name?
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Right. 
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Working with Leonardo.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
What's your name?
The others?
Yes?
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
No, it doesn't.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
She's perfect, perfect.
I believe I have.
So not over her, in fact.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Two?  That's it?
What?
Why not?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Oh sure.  Of course.
What?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
I-I-I...
Who? Tell me!
Yes, ma'am.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
I wanna report a robbery!
No way.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
No.
Are they all crazies?
What for?
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Right, Mack!
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Through the ass.
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
I refuse!
I don't trust you!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Gary Blinker...
What's this?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me. Hit me!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
He's not!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
I see...
Time out!
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
Because I quit breathing.
Okay. Who else?
Martini out!
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
To help you relax... please...
No...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Hi.
Big man!
On what?
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Tha's your problem.
Huh?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Evenin', ma'am.
Why, sure, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
That!
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
He's dead.
No, she wasn't my sister.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Why?
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Let's find a telephone.
Yes.  We did.
Your great aunt.
No...
Dwayne?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Hi there...
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Non.  Please.
My name's 
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I'm in love with you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
He's safe.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Because.  I know where he is.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Tell me.
Oh.  That's nice.
You too.
What?
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
In that case... no...
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
Just since yesterday.
You would?  Really?
Really?
And more...
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
He's a podiatrist or something.
No.  He's never asked me.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
It's a coincidence.
You don't have a passport.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
What'd you find?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
'Course he does.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
...and a fortune teller.
What?
What if he doesn't like me?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
And Larry?...
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
What?  You know him?
Went to high school with him. But...
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She's not here.
That's really romantic.
Ten billion to one.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
Why should he forget it?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
That was the idea.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Boss loader!
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Hello, Edie.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
Do you like pigeons?
I only live up there and across the roof.
I don't know.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Terry, what's wrong?
You?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Well, it's over.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Let me by.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
I'll find you a priest.
Good luck.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
Such as what?
Yeah?
Yeah, really!
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
I told you lay off.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Be sure they got enough water.
Looking for me?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hit me again.
Easy. Easy, boy.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Gimme.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if—
Aw, Johnny... .
I was only talkin' to her.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Okay.
Then..then what's that music?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
I'm afraid I'll faint.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
And the one driving the other car?
Yes, it is.
What?!
No, thanks.
He didn't want me to.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Till they got busted.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Who are you?
Yes.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
You're right.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
I'm a tourist.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
I saw Karen Sisco.
You know how I felt about her.
And then they'll kill 'em.
I'll go with you.
It was an unusual experience.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Call and tell you.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Why you think is today?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
Sure.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Peter Finch.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Shit...
Who was it answered the phone?
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do we do that?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
She did, huh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
To warn her about Chino.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I don't know...
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
You're not?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Really?
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
Your dog was killed?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
We don't get to talk much any more.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I see that.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Not at all.
So?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
No.  Course not.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Are they dead?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Home of the brave!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Six P-40's.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
Well...sure.
Hang on.
We can explain, Colonel.
Bombers.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
Yes'm.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
You too, 'Mam.
You too, Lieutenant.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We're all going away.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Learn English, then!
I'm not telling.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Good—bye, Grandma.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Peggy Sue!
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
That's disgusting!
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Charlie...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
I know. Put Scott through college.
I'm not going.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Why wait?
They'll learn to live with it.
Would you?
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Who?
Save it.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
What am I going to do with you?
I have to talk to you..
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
You're going to listen to me.
Right here. Now sit down.
What?
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
What would that be, sir?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Okay.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
What a treat.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
What?
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What about?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
You have an incredible memory.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Richard, take it easy.
Give me some credit, will you?
What are you doing?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Wait! I'll go with you!
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I'm not burying him here...
He was dead. You know he was.
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Right here, Mom...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
Sorry...
Andy?
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
No.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
No sweat, buddy.
A carrot?!
Don't do this, Andy.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Little baby girl.
Continue.
Continue.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
They didn't fire her?
Do you... pray?
What happens?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I still am.
Sure thing.
Something like that.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
No.
Really?
Thank you.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Is that a question?
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
It satisfied me.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
How many do you know?
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
My lettuce is wilting.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Dr. J.!
We ought to be suing him.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Look deeper.
Entered our minds.
Think about what?
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Riddick? How close?
We can't make it.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I would try for them.
It's starting....
Like the light is scalding it.
Possibly.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Let's wait on the power cells.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
What, you're goin' off, too?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
We're all on the same hajj now.
What?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Looks clear.
Not if I'm the one.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
What, it's broken?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Do you have any weapons?
Just the same, I want one.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Good luck then.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
But how long is a day?
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
But I'm not prepared to die.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
What about it?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
A hearing.
Which one?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Taylor, please --
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
He doesn't know.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
Where's Elias come from?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Who gives a shit!
Sounds like it.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
These two holes are yours...
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
How careful should I be?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
He got in here how?
Sure... but somebody always does..
That's all there is.
You didn't have to tell him that.
That's putting it mildly.
Dance? Here?
You don't know who he is?
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
And Betty Mayfield--
Do you have to leave the note?
Wonder what?
That, and the fun of it.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Yes.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
I've never been to Florida.
You were there when I last saw him.
I know that.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
Who's Goble?
This way.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
A thousand.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Martini.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
You're not English.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
I never notice the view after the first week.
Would that make me a heel?
Doesn't answer the question.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Lay off, can't you?
How would you know, Brandon?
Mr. Mitchell.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
With what motive?
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
You get it's brother.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
I've met her.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
I'll know when I find it.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Warm water, no doubt.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
How do you do, sir.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Yes, sir.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Not too far, I hope.
Who's the girl?
Why should I mind?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
What does it look like?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
In an hour, Larry.
I say YES!
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Thanks.
I think you'll do very well.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
...break away completely from--
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
How nice.
Who?
I have to be up early. 
I haven't really thought about it.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Yes, finally.
Fuck off.
Suez.  1956.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
No, thanks Dad.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Now listen...
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Oh no!
Voila!
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
SHIT!!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Yes, sir.
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
What that?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Got it...
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Right here, partner.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
They took a left at the next light!
Figured you did.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
We're not going.
What, Sergeant?
I'll take him.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
It pays.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
I never joke about money.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Off the boulevard.
Why?
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
"Occupational hazard".
No shit.  They expensive?
... dollars?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
No.
He died a long time ago.
I think it's exciting.
He's good at what he does.
Vivian, what the --
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
You won't.
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I more than liked it.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
My what?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
We're letting them slide?
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
I'm up.
Why?
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Where do you fit?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Dummy.
I pray for that.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
What?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I'm just looking, thanks.
I don't think it would fit you.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Of course.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Of course you will.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
I will never doubt again.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Gently.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Veer left. Left. Left!
I thought I was going faster.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
What do I do?
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
He's really very short on charm.
How many could you handle?
-- where?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Over the Albino, I think.
I'll be right back.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
I don't be-leeve this.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Yes.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
There we cannot help you.
Stop saying that!
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Are you a rotten liar.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
And what is that?
No one of consequence.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Good. Then pour the wine.
Australia.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I'm not listening.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Congratulations.
"Keep a shining in...
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
I have hurt your feelings.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
To failure!
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Liebkind, no!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Come on.  Let's get going.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Very nice girl.
Here I come, ready or not.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
We can't play today?
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Ta.  Ta.
Wagner...
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Where are you going vit the light?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Send for Goebbels.
We won.
Back where?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Who are you, friend?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Of course not. Please.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
With the forty thousand dollars?
Just what he told your detective.
Don't you know?
A good reason, I suppose.
What do you know about it?
Huh?
Yes.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Where's the old highway?
Sam.
Does that mean we can't...
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
What makes you sound so certain?
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I have to go, Sam.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
Sam, let's go get married.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
Thank you. Again.
No.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
Uncommon, too.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
What are you running away from?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Good night.
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
At this hour?
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I don't know what you've been saying.
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
What--special autopsy?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
That's it. You get it quick.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
That called ... commanded ...
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
You would.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Well, I do say it.
Thank you.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Nope, I'm through!
Get out of here.
Now don't that call for an extra!
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Good night, sir.
You're insane.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
You did.
You did miss --
I'm heading out of town.
Where to?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Nobody.
What'd you do, Rose?
Well, some fiend might.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Okay.
Five hundred rabbits?
What was your mother like?
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Yeah.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
What are they doing?
Then why does she act so dumb?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
A wonderful woman, boy.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
You're not having lunch?
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Yes, of course.
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin'.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Who?
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
No, sir.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, sir.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
What's the use, there ain't none.
No, you're not.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
More history, Rose.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Be quiet, Rose.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I don't mind.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Now you know what to watch for...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
She's fine, as if you cared.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Yeah.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Same day as before.  I think.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
You don't smoke.
It's not gonna happen.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
What was I supposed to do?
Follow me.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
You're lying...
No.
There probably is.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
You think this is so easy?
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Dead.
Gimmie a minute.
Just got here.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Who is that... ?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
I'm well aware of that.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Keep 'em busy.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
All right. Stand by.
But I have no sister.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Luke!
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Let's see.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
I know, father.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Disintegrated?
I told you, my car broke down.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Janet.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Weiss.
No, don't do that.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
I didn't make him for you
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
So come up to the Lab.
Goodbye
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
...I don't know.
Ohh!
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
...No thanks.
Do you have a phone?
No, I don't belong here.
Sharp -- Real nice.
Don't want weak legs.
...What?
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paul.
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You's the novelty, Champ!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
...Stop jivin'!
...Thanks.
...This man.
Very high an' very fast.
Move your shoulders down.
Why?
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
What's happenin' here?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
That's it, I'm broke.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Do I have to pay juice?
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
I won't.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah, Kayo.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Ya puttin' me on?
When was they here?
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
I never had good footwork.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Fine... That guy's great.
See what?
Would you keep goin'?
Yo, can I have my locker back?
'Bout what?
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Looks, huh?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Let's get outta this stink.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Ice skate.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
...No.
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Whatta these guys want?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Maybe --
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
A tweeting bird?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They?
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
What the hell's a freeway?
That's right, me.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Doom.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Yeah, that's better.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
My brother.  Get inside.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why, what is Tybalt?
But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Art thou hurt?
He shall be endured
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Romeo, come forth.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Amen
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
NO! Mercutio!
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Is she a Capulet?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
And I don't believe you...
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
And then...
How do we know that?
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Bad company...
There's been a slight problem.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Call it a reckoning of character.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
My way is better.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
Eat shit and die slowly...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Let's just say he knows who I am.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Jujitsu.
I do.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Because that's what I would have done...
Not exactly.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You see the bullet?
Yes.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Very ugly.
I think not.
Just like that?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Closest and oldest.
Finish it!
What?
What of it?
You sure?
Gonna be tough.
The Russian would be easier.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
I don't know.
What's that?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
There it is...now what about the others?
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
It's NOT too late!
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
What are you proposing?
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Has he?
Hi.
You deserve it is the occasion.
And I'd take it out on him.
How the hell did he find it?
I know.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
You know I do.
Could it have been this?
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
What are you getting at?
Why would someone do that?
Maybe I should come along.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Hi.
Anything...specific?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Take it or leave it.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well I'm here now.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
So someone did get away.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
I'd like to see you try.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
Lee, you okay?
Those girls drove off because of you.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
I knew you were lying.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Who?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
IT IS CRAZY!
Why LA?
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Fine by me.
No.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
No problem.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Just trying to make it look real.
I'm fine.
Baby Duck?
Any leads?
Are you okay, Lee?
The police can protect you.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Yes, Master.
I know, Master, but...
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
A little.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Did you make the plate?!
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Stooly.
Stool pigeon.
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
No, fish is a PM food.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
It's him.
Going into the restaurant.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
The Feds?!
No...what?
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I still have work to do here.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
His hair... any color.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
No.  No, you didn't.
Where do you think she's going?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
You're coming here?
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Are you a reporter?
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
We'll see.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Twice...
Without oxygen...
A pre-wedding luau?
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
You can turn that finger around.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Six-fifty.
You afraid to try?
No.  You take it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
I'd rather not.
Well, you do have the dress.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
She's the boss.
It's probably because you got him fired.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Happy New Year.
What is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
No.
It was my mother's.
-- it was a betrayal.
About what?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Thank you.  I love you.
Good night.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
He said hello.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, I'm not. 
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
Okay.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
What?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
What?
What?
Sure you do --
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What's she talking about?
I don't think I could really describe it.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
Why not?
You want me to talk to him?
I don't know --
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
What's tira misu?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I don't know.  Do I?
I don't think I have to now.
It's a spice rack.
It plays in 50 states.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
P.  Dad?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Whose show was this on?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Jonah, I'm leaving --
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
I was thirsty.
Get out.
If I didn't go.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You look good yourself.
You did?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
No, Estellita.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Never... never... never!
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Over my dead body.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Yes.
I've had them since the day they were born.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Be still ...
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you be still?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
I was talking to my wife.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Nothing.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
You get off on abuse or something?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You can still work.
Ass first into the world.
I just can't. Okay?
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I don't want to leave you.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Twelve
I know a guy.
Sorry.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
He doesn't have one.
I can't tell you.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Crank or glass?
No, I'm good.
Make me an offer.
Hey, okay.
Hey, I don't play that.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Big Bill
Okay! Okay!
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
It's not my place.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Yeah.
Answer the fucking question!
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
You mean the menacing red car?
And you've got wiener breath.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
That is so unfair.
Don't we always take good care of you?
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
Spit it out, Captain.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Thank you, sir.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
I'd love to hear it.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Keep trying.
Say what, Cap'n?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
It was nothing.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Pass.
Where are you from, Captain?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I don't expect to live that long.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I changed my mind.
Simpson.
I've got a line on one.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
PUSH!
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
It doesn't take this.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Yeah.
I think you're right, Keith.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
But, sir...
Sure, Reiben.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's always a bright side.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
We can't leave it here.
I don't like that one.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
What if our guys open up, sir?
Get back to your positions!
Alright, come with me.
Yeah?
And Sarge?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
What are we likely to run into?
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
For going to school?
Excellent.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Yeah.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
I am.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
I dream about it.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I can accept that.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Hi.
No, I read it on the message.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
No.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
What?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Job?  Being a great date.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Be friends?
Friends with potential.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're shaking.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
No, we don't have to say it.
What's wrong?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No, I don't, I don't.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
She's very successful.
Your car?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
No way.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
I called her up.
Alright.  Key?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Alright!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
I pay you too much.
Look it up.
That's great, thanks.
Nice things cost money.
Yeah.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
I need a drink.
Wine?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pistols?
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Do what?
Thank you.
Oskar -
And killing.
More.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Where?
That's smart.
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
You could start with an apology.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
It’s over, Cotton.
Did you do it?
You have a right to be angry.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
No, I don't.
Not one bit.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I find his work overwrought.
Just for you, Sid.
Tuition’s expensive.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Not good.
..and as lonely as I am...
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Yeah, right.
I'll give you one guess.
Are you in danger now?
I have to watch rehearsal.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
But she's standing right next to you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
He's after me.
Where you going?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Do I?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Good bye Ben.
Closer than you think.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Catch him, or kill him.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
What Rielly?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Sid I can see you!
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Someone stole Sid's file?
What?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Sure.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Need to get in that building?
Good twist.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Let's get out of here!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Huh, fine.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
W-what do you want?
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Are you sure?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Yeah...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Where the fuck did she go?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
You sleep in THAT?
Hey, hey, it's just me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
You're making popcorn?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
I told you not to hang up on me.
More of a game, really.
They'd never make it in time.
No...
NOOO!
Turn off the light.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Come on, yes you do.
YES!
No it's not. It was Jason.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Forget it.
Ricki Lake.
What's your favorite scary movie?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
No you didn't.
She's the Scream Queen.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
I'll be right back.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
The official term is "psychotic".
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
How do you gut someone?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I'm in.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
I read about it in the paper.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Why?
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Murderers like you?
And, why is that?
What the fuck is going on here?!
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
I realize that.
No one yet.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Nothing.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Bear with me.
No.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Him?
You got to be kidding.
I don't.  Neither do you.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Kiss me on the lips.
I can't let you do this...
I can't do this now... please.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
He mentioned it.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Why don't you finish the job?
Huh...? No...no water.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Yes sir...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Sir?
Grab hold!...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
He just couldn't wait...
Scar?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Cut it out, will ya...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
From the beginning...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
It isn't fair...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Oh God, Tommi...
You'll never get away from me!
Oh, damnit!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
I haven't the slightest idea.
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You don't remember?
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
1976.  What happened back then?
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
It's good.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Right you are, governor!
Twenty pounds on delivery
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Partners!
A share of the profits.
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Yes, but very well.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
it will be all right, madam.
Every word.
As soon as I have found my muse
She is always Aphrodite.
To my weekly confession.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
What do we do now?
Burbage says you have a play.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Who is there?
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
That's my line!
You cannot marry Wessex!
Orsino…good name
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I will do my duty, my lord.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
It is only ours you can know.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Just serve.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Juliet?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don't hear this.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Security.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
I beg your pardon?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
So I gathered.
About the mail --
Where do you think you'll go?
But there's no --
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
What?
That's all?
I see.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Well, yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
His car's still there.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Did what?
I'm just looking.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
And now you tell me.
Who was it?
Don't you?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
David?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
You're frightened.
Everything.
Alex.
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
You were going to say something.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Yes.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
No one. I promise.
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
It wasn't like that.
Sorry?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
I'm not sure --
I'm boring?
That's what I thought.
No.
It's an improvement.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
The first one was fine.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Who?
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I gotta talk to you.
But you don't know what happened.
-- What?
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
... what?...
Uh-uh.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
I guess so.
Hungry?
Yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Am I what?
Why?
You think that's funny, don't you?
She is.
Great.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Probably the bathroom.
No, I'm sure.
Okay.
Great.
Yeah... I mean great.
And what?
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
-- this guy with Jill.
No you didn't.
You were great.
Mmmm --
Look who's talking.
-- yes, you --
-- do you want ice?
Why?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
Don't go, Jackie...
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- Oh yeah.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
What's gonna happen?
Honey, what happened?
I am?
Of course I like children.
What!
Great.
Hello.
Who?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Ha, ha.
Commercials.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- go ahead.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Jesus.
Thank you.
In a way. But...
Sure.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
I know what you mean.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Oh, hey...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
I know.
Who?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Oh yeah...
Yes I do.
I'll call you back.
What do you mean?
Okay.
Is that right?
I am?
Then you were talking to him.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Aren't you going to have one?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Jackie, what're you doing?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
George is great but I know what you mean.
-- No. No really.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
-- never mind.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Jill.
No... how long did you say?
John...
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
Yes, Dad.
I guess so.
What?
Yeah.
Tony.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay, Mom.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny!
Yes.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yes.
How do you like it?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well...
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Royalty?
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thank you, Susie.
Uncle Al-
Blue. This blue.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
What kind of noises?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Sure.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I told you!
But Uncle Al! You said-
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Really?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
What?
You did what?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Yes, Betty?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Um, I don't really know this one...
Again!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
What?  What time is it?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She won't?  Why not?
Honey.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Again?
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
It's true!
What did He say?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
A what?
And whom would you call?
Your cell is more than adequate.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Come, Sister.
Mary Clarence!
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I am?
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
The majority has spoken.
But...
He didn't do you a favor.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Maybe Hawaii.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Me too.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hail, Mary.
A hiding place.
They open a window.
Maybe. 
Take care of it.
Which one!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
She's praying.
That should have tipped us.
Yes?
Which convent was that, Sister?
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Find 'em!
Many have.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
To place it inside its coffin.
Bring him.
You will stay at her side?
Does that look like an animal hanging?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
I know it.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I did not ask you to, did I?
I'm sure I don't know.
What kind of nuts?
I have others.  All I need is this.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
What happened?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
We should go.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
Take the reins.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
What troubles you?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Just... keep where you are.
Come with me.
It was you there?
And, what did he say?
What did he say, Katrina?
What would you have me believe?
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
I can show exactly.
Yes.  Here...
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
It's too big.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Childers.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I aim to kill you with it.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Yeah.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I reckon I feel all right.
You told me to come by.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
I don't reckon I know.
Naw.
Yeah.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Is that right?
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Did Karl go to bed?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
Me, too.
I ain't got no boy.
I want to come back and stay here.
Naw.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
What's that you say?
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
It's my birthday.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Better make it charge. 
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
What's the difference?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Hi, Auggie.
You got it.
Ready. Any time you are.
Eighteen and a half years.
You're looking good, Auggie.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You don't give up, do you?
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
It's all yours, baby.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Huh?
And these?
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
What does that mean?
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Jesus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
It'll cost you five bucks.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Yeah? And why is that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I don't have much time. 
You don't really want to know.
Why don't you go to the police?
You work too hard, you know that?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
It's all right. I really do know them.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Yes, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
Carl Heine's type.
You don't.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Why not?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Well, it seems to me...
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Twelve.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I have told the truth.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Won't take two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You're wondering why I held it.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Still lashed to the mast.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Maybe...?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Bull fiddle.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
What did he say?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
I'll say.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
And I'm Daphne.
Down, Daphne!
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Fight it.
Good night, Josephine.
But this is so humiliating.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
That's right.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
I am.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Shut up and keep packing.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
No, no.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
You got some?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I met one of them.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
You like it?
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Flower girl.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
My car?  Why, you -
It's not the backs that worry me.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Every time!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Would you mind terribly?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Well, I'm not.
- riding to hounds -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
They repealed Prohibition?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Bon voyage.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Talk about sad.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
I knew you would.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
I know.  Every time!
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Booze.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
I already told you.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Why wouldn't I?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Oh, don’t be that way.
Mom, please.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Oh, hello.
Hello, Katmandu.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
I have regrets.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Love.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Shampoo, got it!
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, “Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.” Trust me, I’m careful.
Show me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Desperation?
Yeah.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
You don't live around here, do you?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Sometime, but not like this.
That's right--
What's his name?
What he talk 'bout?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
What do that mean?
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Mornin', Daddy...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
David!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
That's right!
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
Did you find your father?
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
Yes, ma'm...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Is there something I can do to help you?
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Will they give him a trial?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
There are more important matters right now...
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
About what?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Okay.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
YOU DO?!
What Cartman?!
Whoops.
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Uhh...
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Aw, ma!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Yeah...
YOU BASTARD!!
Our moms suck!
I don't know, dude.
What's the difference?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
What is 'fisting'?
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Cheers, Terrance!
You did? Just now?
I am.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Don't call me dumb!
No! It can't be!
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
And the butfor?
He's shutting off the air!!!
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Oh Sara...
It can't be.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Well shut it off at once!
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
It's steady, good benefits.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Will you shut up already?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
You're right.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Helllp!
You too.
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm about to blow the wall.
We have room!  Let's go!
It would matter to us.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
That is one of my priorities.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
The pin machine?
Can I get you something for the road?
It belonged to my dad.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Are you guys bruddas?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
No kiddin'.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
I'd buy it!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
It's mine.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Don't say that about my mom!
I'm getting to like it here.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Cool!
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
How Mr. Kastle?
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Coming right up.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
The mental hospital.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
So, what about you?
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
So why do you stay?
More than you could afford.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why not?
It's Junior, isn't it.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
I am a professional man.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Open it, Captain!
It's burning...
Back away then.
What is it?
How about I just press the button?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Working on it now, sir.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
In a minute, sir.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Yes, Harry.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
A break for what?
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Too big?
I love secrets.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
It never occurred to me.
My gosh, Norman.
Beth --
Beth.
What are they?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
You went through Edmunds' things?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
I would.  But my suit --
You don't trust me?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Still clear.
The refridgerator.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
You think?
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
What?
You think, in the sphere --
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How long does it last?
How fast does it take effect?
Where are you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
You think I manifested the snakes?
C'mon -- what?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Don't you know?
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
What?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Who says it's a he?
I never said that.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
Another attack?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Am I?
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What happened to her?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
You got her?
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
The others, sir?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
You mean a picture?
Why's that?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I don't know.
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Not bad.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
He's bluffing...
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Send one squad up.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
It's automatic.
Why?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Come back here... Where are you going?
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Death to all bugs !
Not enough, I guess.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
What's the hurry ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Your father will never let you.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You and me, huh ?
Zander, please... Let's go !
So who's got time to get married ?
I don't know, Zander.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
I have good reflexes.
I'll meet you outside.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
No way, ma'am !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Hut... hut !
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
How come we never got together ?
No thanks, Diz.
You saying you didn't ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Looks like rain.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Oh, is that how it is ?
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
No, sir.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
To join with him.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The Creator has not answered.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
That is how V'ger will survive.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
This served the purpose.
A tractor beam...
Decker....!
Hold relative position here...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
I want him here.  Sit down!
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
To you, sir?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You bet your life.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
I beg your pardon?
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Everyday things...yes.
...I always thought so...
I love your script.
Yes.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Never saw the point of 'em.
Paperclip?
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
Oh, God...
One moment.
You going to ask me in?
The other side.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
<u>Please</u>...
Gosh, you look nice.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
That's so beautiful...
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
We had a date.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Courthouse back in town.
What?
Hi.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
She wasn't in the...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
What'll I do for fun?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
I don't eat vegetables.
Bourbon and Milk.

You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
I...
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
You can go...
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
There's other things to be learned.
Who is it raped you?
Well, what's the beef?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I like you, too.
Who is that...?
I...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
I just...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I know, I know.
...she has a <u>home</u>...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Yes.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Who got their heads cut?
You said <u>three</u>...?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Doug, this is Mr...
You were in the car with Bob?
He told you that...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Later for you, pal.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Yes.
Sure.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
I left that for you.
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
We don't have the money.
If you do the product placement...
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Sherry, this...
Sherry, Sherry...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...it is?
Mmm...
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I hate when you say that.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Sex.  Of course.
During sex.
I live.  In the same country.
Like how?
Like a big sister.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
And...?
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Great.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
This is a joke, right?
Yes.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
That's so weak.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Fine.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I have lava.
Is that like Luigi's?
Where are you, anyway?
Yes.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Is your bad?
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Oh.
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Have you still never told him?
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
We're not discussing your age.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
We're going to win this.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Don't flatter yourself.
Ironic, huh?
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
And you said...
You mean, after I'm dead?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Are we.
Don't be too sure.
Give 'em my number.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
No, there isn't.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Yeh, it's cheaper.
For what?
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
I think so...What do you think?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Hey. What's up?
What?
Thanks, Scoob.
Thank you.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes.
No.
My grandchild-baby.
He's dead.
He wasn't.
I am sure.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Yes, Mikey?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
You mean, again?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Just the same.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Gee, you're home early!
Uh huh.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
...gger.
Again!!
Yeah.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
He did?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
Yeah?...
Because I'll be firing at them.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
She's still alive.
What do you mean?
How much do they have?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
We can't--it's power driven!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
What?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
That's government property, Major.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
That's right, sir.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Yes, sir.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
That's close enough, Major.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Peace on earth.
What the hell is Plan-R?
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Naturally I am, sir.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Call them every five miles.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Ready, Major.
Very interesting.
Everything still checks out okay.
He's dead.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
I don't get you, King.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Sorry, King.
But I get a red light.
Let me check.
Roger.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Yeah.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Yeah.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
What's it about?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
What?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
What, they're looking for her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Erica is in the van back there.
She's dead.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Yeah.
I can come visit?
This is private property, my friend.
Are you talking to me?
Glad it's okay.
Good. See you later.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
No, not really. Middle-class.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What'd he get you?
Military marching bands.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Pony and I are friends.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Because I'm alienated.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Ask your girlfriend.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Man?
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Name one.
One!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Tim!
I would've stopped it.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Yes, you do.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
God, you smell like whiskey.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Oh, fuck it, man!
'Bye, Jeff.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
What do you mean?
What?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I don't know.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Hey!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
It's pretty exciting.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Hey.
I'm always serious.
Yep.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
That's because I am.
Really? What else does your mother say?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
I'm here.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Come on, Jeff.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Cleo!
It's twins!!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Wayne Gretzky.
No...I've been pregnant.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
She thinks you went to the police.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Spit from your dad?
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
He Ikea'd us.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Kim-Lo?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Bullets.
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Definitely old.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
More proof God's a guy...
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
Hi, Artie.
Let it ride for a while.
That was the general idea.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Thank you.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Life can be beautiful!
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
Second generation, huh?
Was I?  I'm sorry.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
You did.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
And you'll play Salome?
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Where do you live?
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Just a scene I cut out.
Okay.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I've lost my car.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Just follow me.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Good night.
Good.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Who?
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Thank you, Max.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But where?
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
What is it?
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Sorry, mistress.
It's what we were warned about.
No, a super girl.
Eliminate her.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
What do you want?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
You love me?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Why not ?
No.
Well...I guess one is all right.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
What?
She has hostages.
I did.
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I'll drink to that.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Supergirl?
George---I thought you'd never ask.
I've got things to do.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Oh, no thanks.
The scoop of the year!
You're supposed to guess.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Can you create life?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
She's a beast.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Cigarette?
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Why?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
There's no vodka in it.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
No, thanks.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Can I help?
Uh-huh.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Oh. You're going away.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Thirty-five.
I know, I'm the fault.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
First question got to be "Where."
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
KRYPTONITE!
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Fair's fair.
You designed it?
What will it do?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Watch out for them air pockets!
And do what?
I didn't have my camera with me.
What about me?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You just did, with that great dinner.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
But the other night...
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Missing????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
What's wrong?
A normal person.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
You're not selfish at all.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Everything on it.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Constantly.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Cuba.
Free!
I really don't think . . .
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm not so sure you do.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
An angle?
Something . . . wonderful.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
A toupee that flies?
But why the hair?
Get the box, nephew.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
There!
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
Destiny.
I am master now.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
North. It's north
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Unbelievable.
What the  --  !
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Not unless you can fly.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Screaming
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
First the pets, Otis.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
But so is Vond-El
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
He will be odd, different.
Enjoyed it?
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Twenty-four.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
He is. Usually.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
You think they're strange?
195 pounds.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
She didn't.
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
Was it good?
Okay.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
How?
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
C'mon, you know that won't...
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Good night.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
And what's that?
What's that, Dolores?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Isn't it a lovely day?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Did he say what about?
That's what he said.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
What, Mason?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Will you be spending more than a night?
She...she was a friend of mine.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Don't you want to hear?
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
What is it?
No.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Don't even try to remember.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
As opposed to this T.V.?
I don't know.
Hitler!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Alone or surrounded?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Why?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
J.J., Steve isn't...
No.  I'm going home.
Now don't kid a kidder.
I don't believe it.
I'll listen one more minute.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Talk to her yourself...
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
What about?
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
He wants me to break a leg?
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Yes, but why?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Smile?
Where you going?!
Yes.  Throw it in.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Correct.
Please continue...
Respect your elders and your betters!
But I promised your mother.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
and totally irrelevant.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
Colonel. Pleasure.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I was warned.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
I wish to say something.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
This is absolute nonsense!
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
I don't understand what you mean.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
How could I forget?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
His private life?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Nope.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
You're late.
Great.
I thought you did.
We will, kiddo.
What's it to ya?
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Freezing.
I volunteered.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
That's the way it was told to me.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
No.  Never.
Kyle...
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
Of course.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Like shit, boss.
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
I don't think he's breathing.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
What are you talking about?
You should be.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
Never mind.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
My hero.  Let's go.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Why... ?
Right.  Call me Christy.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
Get out.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
I didn't say anything.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
You call them...
What are you doing?
Fuck you.
I saw them kill him!
Stop it!
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Single?
No.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Why?
Okay.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Yes.
Of course, Nick...
I hope.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
Humor me with specifics.
And if nothing's lacking?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Have we met?
The key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
No.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Follow me.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You know you can.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
What?
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Greetings.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Do we still get paid for the week?
It's a question.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
-- how much is this car worth?
Where in the hell can she be.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Nell.  You will come here now.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Who?
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
I don't know what you mean.
That's why we're here.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
What kind of food?
Oh, god.
Not bad.
Where do we go?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
No one else is even here yet.
That would be too easy.
What post office?
Well, those are the breaks.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
She never told Eddie, though.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Something like that, yeah.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Have you ever known me not to be.
I'll bloody well ask him.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
No kidding.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I got half.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Walked.
Susan.
-- You know his name is Frank.
You know I don't live with him.
Ah.
I don't.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Oh, Mr Crane--
I don't understand.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Sure.
Yeah.
That'll be fine.
Uh-huh.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Mm.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Who?
How's that?
How are you?
You don't have to--
You don't have to tell me anything.
*I* was with her.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...who among us is in a position to say...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
What'd he say?
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Uh... you're under arrest.
It better be good.
What's the combination?
You said the system couldn't fail!
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You're kidding.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
I believed them.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Correct.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
Oh shit.
Not so loud.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Read it out loud.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
He's right.
Yes, I do.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Big as a house.
Keep the animal quiet.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Frock's been fired.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
What kind of hormones?
Eats them?
How about lunch?
I don't understand.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
Would you mind showing it to me?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
What are you going to do?
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I have to shoot.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
That's right.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
What's to see?
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
--a dead one at that.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
It has to be the reality.
A window onto the human condition?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Saturday?
So when are you leaving?
Who?
I told you I can't.
Yeah...
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
What's that?
Gee, that's great.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, my God!
I don't know--
Put some butter on it--or ice?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
There's no one here.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
How?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
Your guess?
I think they have that covered.
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
It's locked?
I'm in the vending room.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
All I told them was the truth.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I'd been told as much.
I can't really talk right now.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I don't know why I think they went right.
This is great. This is fitting.
Mulder --
Yeah...?
I don't know.
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
She was with me.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
A pocketful of rye...
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Okay.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
You don't know the procedure.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
What did you see?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
What happened to Charles Gish?
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Mocky-Lock.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I think that's the whole point.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Dr. Kent.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
What else do we do?!
I don't have to.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Ja, ja, ja.
Sit down.
He has a little dog.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Yes.
He was Harry's driver?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Dr. Winkel.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Anna.
We're both in it, Harry.
I'm so sorry.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Thank you.
And my passport?
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
They'll be returned, miss.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Yes.
No.
Once in a while.
I can't say that I have.
Ever seen one?
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Bring him in.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
This way, miss.
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
What is it, Sergeant?
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Yes.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
You can help her.
Why not?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What's the name of this girl?
Vinkel.
In great pain?
Who?
Must be some mistake.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
Now, hold on.
I am not a bad man.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Funny?
A novel, Mr. Martins?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Help you out?
Just take it, OK.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
One or two kilometers.
Why?
We're ok.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
You can swim?
Two.
They don't have extermination camps.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Then I won't bring you....
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I have a job.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
People still need values, beliefs....
I don't care about money.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Even though his dick is so big?
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
What??!?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Why?
He has Israel.
Are all Jews the same?
A forty-five.
I can't say that.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
Fine.
They're not my people....
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
I've got to get back to the --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You could do it.
What...?
You said they didn't have night guards.
So what do we do with the device?
JTS...?
Wow, that's uh...great...
Get out of my way.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
No.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Hello!
Yes.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
In a lake.
What was he like, when he was little?
Italy!
Congratulations, Enzo.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Enzo...
Yes, I know.
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
What room have you got?
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
What?
... And his friend, Johana...
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm still here.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Johana... New York.
He doesn't hear too well.
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
No.  I'm just depressed.
Of course, that's what they're for.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
... Yes?
Let him sleep.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Please, call me Mordechai.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Yes Esther.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mazel Tov!
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
It's Friday.
Why not?
That depends. How much money has he?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
What about me?
I sleep it off.
What do you want to see him for?
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
I thought they came right past here ——
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
I know. Funerals.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
You drive a hard bargain.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
You’re mad...
Have you finished?
No!
Leon hung himself...
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
Something like that.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Can you tell me how you spell...
Croissants. Like that...
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Italian? The Mafia...?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
What about your friendly cop?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Where is he?
I certainly did, sir...
How are you, Jane?
Good.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
It’s not.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
Your secretary, huh!
Recommended?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Jah...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Yeah.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Can I get up now?
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
... No.
How’s the boy doing?
I... How long have I been here?
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Cinq cents.
That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
I can only tell you what he told us...
That’s what he said...
It’s a good guess...
What’s that? A word?
That's a good idea, sire.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
I promise...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
What... what do you mean?
You make it sound so simple...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
But it is what I want.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Not yet!
I -- I don't understand...
Good.
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Performing a miracle.
We want her burned as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
In a village called Domremy.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Not long ago...
Yes...
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
And may I go to Mass?
You have nothing to regret...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
... You look wonderful...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
Yes.
That's not a lot.
He's on the other side of the river.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
The wind will be against us...
We need another ten minutes...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Perfectly.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
That's now what I meant...
No!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Don't swear...
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
My king.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why not?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
What are you doing on the wall?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
And what does he say to you?
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Dorota.
He'll be back before curfew.
He'll be here soon.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
How will we sleep?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
I'll be fine.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What, I'm working, what?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
It costs.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Toilets?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
God forbid!
Sorry, I don't remember.
We're getting out.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
To be deaf?
... without a shred of manners.
No sound at all?
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Baines is packing up?
Yes, it's unholy.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
On your property?
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
I don't want to learn.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
You mean in signs?
They are washed.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
Naw, it's okay.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
All of it.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
If that's the way you want it.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
I'm busy, Floyd.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
I picked something up on the way.
You know anything about him?
It was too noisy.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Yeh.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Five and call.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
But I got a train to make.
Where you goin'?
Yeh, this time anyway.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Yeh, he knows that.
Then why the rat?
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
Why don't ya then.
I'll make parole.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Never heard of the place.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He'll never do it.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Is that what it means?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
He's just around the corner.
Dorothy!
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I didn't.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Now do you believe me!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
What do you mean?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Disappeared!
Oh, thank heaven.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
That's the truth.
He's been dead for three months.
You see how much we have to say.
What would your mother say to that?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
He's all right.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
She could tell you where father is.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
What do you mean?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Nunheim!
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
No.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
I see.
Goodbye.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
What did you do with the rest?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Never mind.
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
I didn't knock Julia off.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
That last Martini.
That's jolly.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Breakfast.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Couple of months anyway.
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
It's the only way it makes sense.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Police!
Yes.  Nick!
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
It's a fortune box.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Oh, God.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
We can't just go off and--
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You said he was a deserter.
What if I do?
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Blow me.
There might be.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I did it!  I got the box open.
Wait.  Wait.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
Wh-what do you think--
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Millionaires, man.
...I know.
I got that...sir.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Mine.
Mine.  Land mine!
Just relax.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Shut up and listen!
It's a fire fight.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
So where do we start?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
Jesus, Jaeger.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Wes is dead!
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Makes two of us.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then what?
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
When did you make the switch?
Really?
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
A headache?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Now you need me.
Naw, nothing.
What?
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
It doesn't mean anything.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
You want to say some words?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Eat your dinner.
Don't go.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What?
I don't know.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We're leaving.
Impossible!
Incredible!
Where is LUH?
I want you for my roommate.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
When?.....How?
No, I...
Look more closely.
No......  She's dead THX........
I'm only trying to help you.
I thought of something.....
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
You the Bomb Squad?
Thanks.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Hey, look--
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
You got it.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
It's from an IRA.
"Punks", huh?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Hey, I'm next.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Who is he?
Taylor's dead.
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay here.
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Look, it's important.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
IRA - instant retirement account.
I'll do it.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Where did you find it?
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
No!
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Nice suit.
I thought so.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron?
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
What is it?
Just as you say, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
I would like to.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
What?
He recognized you!
Spanish passports?
What time is your rendezvous?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Lily-- 
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh! You didn't read it!
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
You're hired!
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Um-hum ...
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
I <u>believe</u> you.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
No--thirty-five! 
<u>Adolph</u>?
Giron...!
I know!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Well--uh--yes and no.
For all the really important things--
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Yes, my bag!
The pumps --
Hurry, Rose.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
She knows.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Can I bum a cigarette?
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Almost as good as you.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Bollocks.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
No, but we're making excellent time.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Could I speak to you in private?
Jack.
Well, here you are.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
She had beautiful hands.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Just move with me. Don't think.
Jack, I --
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Right.
I can't feel my body.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Would you like anything?
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Excuse me.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
I don't understand.
Isn't that interesting?
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Guess again, copper.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Sure!  Excuse me.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Never eat before the show.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Okay.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
You can live that down, can't you?
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
How're the tips?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
No, sir?
Now you're talkin'!
I'll take one. 
What is it?
<U>Me</U>!
Where did you hide it?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'll go with you--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Coming to the pool for a swim?
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
What'll I say?
Sure.
Back is in New York.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Miss Marsh.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
What do you mean?
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Good-night, folks.
About twelve hundred.
Thanks to me.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Good night!
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Hey--you! Where you going?
Then why did you run away?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Well I'm not so go home.
Come and get him.
No...
Yeah, you look it.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
But who was the Devil?
Ignore her?
In vino veritas.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Sorry...
Not half as bad as I feel.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
What was that all about?
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
Never even heard of anything like it.
Wait!
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
I need it.
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Drop his horse.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
What're you talkin' about?
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
I know, I need a keeper.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
We'll see about that.
And still not a thing to watch.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Do you?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Hey - the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Three. You? Married?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Let's not make it a habit.
- You're not.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Trust me.
Are you listening to me?
Next time, I do the driving.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Yes, M.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Of course.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
It doesn't quite add up.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
You leave me no alternative.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
No -
My timing always was lousy.
Fueled and waiting.
Who is it?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
Will the cruise set it off?
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
We got the same thing.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
What is it, noontime?
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
You were in hell?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
It is just a regular card.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Just stay in bed and rest.
It's healing now.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
You should go back and rest.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
Tolerable well.
Now who are we talking about?
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
But what if we leave them behind?
Bye, house.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
HO-YAAAHH!!!
No, you can't.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Sorry.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Woody!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
I can't see a thing!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes SIR!
Last present!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Sid!!!
What?!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
There's no mirror.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
She'll have to learn.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Finn -
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Nothing is left but us.
Why are you talking like that?
What is he being charged with?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
That's frustrating.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
No, not yet.
What do you think?
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
How long's the job?
Sixteen
Just watch.
Who do you work for?
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Depends who it's from.
Depends on the state.
We're playing!
When will you do it?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Something.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Your new friends.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
It was an anonymous tip.
If I can.
Only if he can be trusted.
Everybody has a weakness.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
You won't say anything to my parents?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Agents who died in the field.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Can you not go yourself.
I'd fucking kill you.
Thanks.
Diane.
It's where I live.
And don't make any noise.
No, not holding hands.
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
So why have you told me about it?
It's an interesting theory.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Fuck, OK.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
Aye.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Cheers.
Right.
And you might get the fucking job.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
What do you mean?
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
It wasn't that bad.
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
It was just an idea.
Are you serious?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
you'll need one more hit.
In that case --
Sure will, pal, sure will.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
No joy yet.
Went ballistic?
What?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
I don't have a clue.
A Federation starship.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Understood. Kirk out.
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
If we could send a distress signal...
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Go, Sulu.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Are we leaving, Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Go to sleep, Spock.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain?
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
I did not.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
That's a little vague, Spock -
Hmmm?
The emergency channel, open.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
No conditions.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...


Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
I hide no pain.
I cannot go with you.
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Okay, okay...
That Dillinger's on to him.
Hello, Alan.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
End of line.
The Pentagon?
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Tron...?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Then I owe you some thanks...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
I'm shocked.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Yeah, right.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
You're kidding.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Why?
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
No way.  Not Dana.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Yeah, right.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Okay.  Here she comes.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Put a tap on her phone.
Here they come.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
Sorry.
But you didn't.  Why not?
I'd like that.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Yes what?
You're damaged goods, lady.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
He needed my help.
No.
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Do you still love your husband?
No.  Doris.
I'm not wearing any.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
What about Juno?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
He said he was an American agent.
Go ahead.
Yes.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Yes.  Now go.
His wife.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
This is great, we got cable.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
How come?
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
Want some Goobers?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
There's nothing to tell.
What's your favorite movie star?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Very much. Now, where were we?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Why?
What?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
How come?
Cancoon.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
That rhymes.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
I heard that.
Heard that.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
You got it.
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Good for you.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
Tell me.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Where?
Two guys.
In case.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
No problems on both counts.
I guess so. Follow me.
No.
I can see what you mean.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
I bullshitted him.
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
You were a cop.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I give up. Who are you?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Uh-huh.
What about him?
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Where'd you come from?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Thank you.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
You do.
How the fuck could he know?
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
- Because it's good!
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
I need to go now.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I have to go.
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
James, why don't we...?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I need to make a telephone call.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
It's private.
I'm here about some monkeys.
How did you find me?
Hey, man...
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You want something?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Think you'll live that long?
Same back at you.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
You Harlin?
Yep.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Time.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You son of a bitch!
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Open up!
I want my car.
What's it to you?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Genuine Draft?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You didn't hear something?
The wind isn't blowing.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Come here.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
What about us?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
There has to be!
No.
Not me.  Us.
Give him the money.
You heard me.  Count it out.
You killed him!
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How do you put a price on murder?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
That's a thick change of heart.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
You expect me to believe that?
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Sure, Sheriff.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
All right, old man.  Christ.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
You broke my nose!
Accident.
Live there?
How do you know if you've never tried?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
That's a bit much.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How do you want it?
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
So?
Darrell--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
How much!?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
What sign?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
I'm just going to my car?
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
I have an idea.
You know what I want.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Walk away.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Yeah.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Stop it.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
No! You get it!
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Can you make it back up?
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Oh?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
I said come on!
Wow.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Yes.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Yes. Is this David?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
You use your sleeve.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Jesus.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
It's finished. I won.
You assumed wrong.
Is there a problem?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
One last question.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Yes he is.
What's he look like?
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
How much can you lift?
All of it.
You're lying.
Jeremy listen to what--
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Nope.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Advances?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Shit and fried eggs.
Oh yeah.
Property.
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Uh... Duke.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
No.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Well... I don't recollect.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
What happened, did you hit him?
First one what?
Lemmee see it.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Yeah.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
You ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Yeah... you said that last night.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
The Kid, yeah...
Nothin's bent.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Maybe.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Just like that?
Yeah?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
Bear with me here...
And ?
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Umm ...
Then who goes?
They fucking know everything.
Can we stealth these guys?
Did you hear what he just said?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Maybe more.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Just do what I tell you.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Who's your boss?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
I said I never heard of him.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
I know of him.
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
I completely understand ...
Hold on a second.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
Why is that?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Yes.  I wrote it.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
You're going to settle out of court?
... that's perfectly all right.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Why is that?
...things change.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
How come you're calling me from...?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
I think I will.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
You're talking like a drunk.
I...do you want me to leave?
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
What is that to you...?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What do you want?
Don't touch anything.
I'm going to help her.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I don't want a mistrial.
It's locked.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
How old is he?
I did.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yeah.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes, that's correct.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Almost a year.
No, I'm all right.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Do you live here in the hotel?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Let me come in.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Don't go.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Too late. I've got my face on.
How does it work?
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I need you.
You can't. You're afraid!
I loved you, Madeleine.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Some people prefer it.
What?
Shopping?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Knowing I have to die...
No, thank you.
The tall trees...
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Yesterday.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No.
Yes?! But --
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Madeleine!!
Yes.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Ah, Johnny-O...
I'm having one now.
Oh!
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
That!?!
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Oh?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You're an asshole.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
You fucking bastard!
You go home!
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
What?
What are you talking about?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
There's more.
What about the blood?
Have you ever done this before?
They won't figure it out.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
I know...
I don't think so.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
There's more.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
The groom?
She's still working?
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Who's up for making some real money?
No.
Good God...Good God...
I'm calling the police.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
Shut up Boyd.
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
What you just said. Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
I don't know...
You hate women.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
They need leadership.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Goosed!
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
I do.
I don't think so.
Why what?
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Why? What's his problem?
Of course.
I will.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
No. Just like an hour or so.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Are they fighting?
We're not canceling.
I won't even discuss it.
Yeah. You.
The prostitute.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
What money?
Like how?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
What does that mean?
He's your brother.
Go for it.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
The wahoo?
The wahoo moment?
Where?
That's what I'm thinking.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
The stone age.
Take your time. I wish I had.
Drum banging real times.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You'd like me to kill them?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Don't you ever see him?
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Go away! Leave me alone.
You must listen to me before you go.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Yes, sir.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Where's the dough?
Why?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
Are you Jorge?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
She's left.
No.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Why not?
Mother.
I've had a gutful of this.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
But only you will know he's not human.
I'm getting by.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
You think he's smart?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Got it.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
He hears...everything.
It feels so.. .real.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
All my work is my finest.
Help me get out of here.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
It wasn't a lie.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I know who would know.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Stop me.
Nothing.
You like baseball?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Sid?
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...

Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
The American "people"?

A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...

And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..."

No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...

No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Please, no thanks... 
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?

It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Coulda been a contender.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Not in here Dad... please. Later.

Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
So you're hot on this stock?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Oh no, no...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
...I can't even see it...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Allright. Wait here...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
How much?
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Break it.
You really do believe in destiny?
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
...how do you know? You wish...
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
It's over you, Gordon.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you Jenkins
They seemed, closing by much 
Vell.  Goodnight.
What?  Tony and China, together?
China
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Hi there Sarah
They're all human beings
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
What do you mean?
A ghost?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Do you really think so?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Mm-hmm.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Nope.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Do you?
What do you think?  Guess.
Have you been hurt?
I don't know.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Is everything alright?
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
I've never even met you.
Wait!  Don't go...
You do?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Please leave me alone.
Claire.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
...just so she could cut them off.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Okay, I'm a little tender.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
What?
What?
I don't...
The planchette?
M-E...
Jody, wait.
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
Hartford?
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Relieved?
No.
It's Saturday.
Fine.
We did.
Tomorrow.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
I know.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
You're kidding.
Wow.
I'm so sorry.
What?  No.  No.
Did you call about the Feurs?
No.  Look!  In the window.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
We had a seance.
Then where is she?
But I don't remember.
...Please stop...
Wouldn't go that far.
STOP IT!
What?
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Huh.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Two what...?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Nothing was ever more false.
Every day  twice.
What are you talk---
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I under5tand.  All the same
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
The lamplight.  That's all.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
'He'...?
FAST.
He just went out like & light-
Lie...?
Always loved you..
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I bring her flowers too.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Rowan...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
He fools around with his patients too.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
God knows, I'm intriguing.

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
A little wine...?
Did you see the old man on the ---
Talking to me dear...?
Your beneficence.
I don't know.
What were you talking about...?
Go ahead.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Stop it!
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
You can't just -
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
Papers...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
The one on the left - definitely...
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
No - not all the time - I mean
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Yes - I have had it for years.
Sure...
I think I will pass...
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Why should I?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
No thanks - 
What was I supposed to do?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Yes I can...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Were you always this sick?
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Well, Dad said...
Cut it out, before you break something!
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I love those springy head puppies!
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
These are real, live women?
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
So that's a maybe?
Yeah? You like?
You have changed since second grade.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
It's my private business! Mine!
Dad, please.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Of course we are.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Got it.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Very funny.
My room?
I meant biologically.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I have absolutely no intention--
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
I'm trembling with excitement.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Not a chance.
You're quick. I like that.
Yellow pages?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
I'll make you very proud.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Rules are rules.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Of course I like girls.
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
That's perfect.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
It's about your parents.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Thanks.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
She still work there?
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
The skinny brunette.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
You could say that.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
You have someplace to be?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
Where's this coming from?
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
I said he did.
Your Honor... Please...
Lombardo ever come out here?
What brain?
I think we just need to get wasted.
Shit.
Hi, Mon.
You notice my new jumper?
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
In back of the garage.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Stick?
Why can't you come...
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
That's not your line.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You think that's wise?
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
You got something against cigarettes?
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Put Kelly on too.
We?
Hi, Sandy.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Funny.  So am I.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Starting with a screw?
Prepare what?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
All what?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Relax.  We're almost there.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Of course not.
In the next two minutes?
What is this?  A whole new train?
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
You tell me.
My friend?
This is Colonel Richards.
Nicely said, sir.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Right.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Not today, Willow.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Say what?
I will!  But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
You hear trouble.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Where the hell did you come from?
Elora Danan!
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
No!
That's all I ever wanted!
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Surrender!!
He never misses.
Shut up.
I changed her already!
The sorceress.
Not one this big.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
I thought I was the English.
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
...I want to say a thing.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Yeah.
Maybe.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
What?
You tell him. When you're able.
Hochmut?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I know what he said.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
That's your way, not mine.
I didn't even know about it.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
I admit I don't know where he is.
I don't know where he is.
Yes.
You didn't have to...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
His name is John Book.
No...
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
They don't have any shit.
My son is out there!
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Who are you?
I don't believe you!
This?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Whenever you wish.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Oh -- yes.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, you....
No --
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Oh...
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Lions and tigers and bears!
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Hah!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Ohhh!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohhh --
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Yes --- there.
Leave her alone!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Ah --
What's the matter?
I -- Oh --
Fine.  He's got a plan
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
This way!  Come on!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Whozat?
Yeah.
Not nohow!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
To Oz!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
A heart --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Ho -- ho --ho
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
I could come for a second opinion?
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I took the initiative.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
The worm on the hook again.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
It’s the only way out...
I know.
No. You’ll be safe here.
I have to go to work.
Really?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
Where did you get this?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
How appropriate.
Bond!
Could...could you come?
Your father...
Of course...
Yes.  Au revoir...
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
God isn't there to do it.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Because --
Cured, yes.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
The missing scientists.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Where did he go?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Janey, will you marry me?
Jon??  You mean he's --
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Ever see one of these before?
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Is that a fact?
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
That's exactly why we need them.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Yorgi asked me to.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
You don't have to do that.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
That's would be me.
They come in any other styles or colors?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
Why you dogging me up?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
When else are you gonna do it?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Its core?
I don't like him being here.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
We have to find Magneto.
What's that?
You know, you --
What if I like the pain?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
He takes his work seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
What do you want?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
It does indeed, Max.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Yes, sir?
MMmmm.
Well... yes.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Whatever makes you happy.
Darling!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
How old are you, young man?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
You must be Igor.
I beg your pardon?
What wockers?
What?
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Why?
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
... I'm glad that's...
Act casual!
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Ja, ja.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you've done it, master.
Me?  Sing?
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
I see what you mean.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
But will they make good use of them?
Thank you.
Certainly, Sin
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
